## Work

This week we started to get back into the swing of things---our "think
week" was over, a new product manager had arrived, and a new roadmap
had been drawn up for the next few months.  We're aiming to put
something in front of users some time this quarter, which will be
good, as I'll finally get to write more directly about what I'm
working on!

I went on support on Wednesday, but it's been a fairly quiet shift so
far, so I've had the opportunity to get involved with some of our dev
tooling issues.  This stuff is mostly worked on in people's free time,
but it's all useful stuff---for example, one person has been working
on bringing continuous deployment to GOV.UK---I got to fix up a few
issues with our tooling to connect to machines, and also made a little
progress on making our use of [rake][] a bit more consistent across
our apps.  Hopefully I'll have some time to continue that next week as
well.

Speaking of next week, I'm still on support Monday and Tuesday, then
back on my team on Wednesday, then on leave on Thursday and Friday.
I'm toying with the idea of taking every fourth Friday off,
periodically giving me a longer weekend.

## Books

This week I read:

- [A Darkness at Sethanon][], the final book in Raymond E. Feist's
  [Riftwar Saga][].

## Miscellaneous

Not much happened this week.  I made [a cheat "sheet" for Pulp
Cthulhu][] and [a spellbook for my D&D character][], but then in
today's D&D session my spellbook got erased by some sort of magical
being, so the utility of that PDF was short-lived.
