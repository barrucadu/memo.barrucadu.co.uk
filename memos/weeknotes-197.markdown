## Work

Another short week, as I took Monday and Tuesday off.


## Books

This week I read:

- Volume 14 of [So I'm a Spider, So What?][] by Okina Baba

  This deals with the battle in the elf village and the killing of
  Potimas, and also gives a lot of backstory from Ariel's,
  GÃ¼liedistodiez's, and Potimas's perspectives of the time before the
  System up to its introduction by D.  I feel that most of the story
  has been covered now, most things have been explained and wrapped
  up.  The two big remaining issues, which I expect will be the focus
  of the final two volumes, will be the other reincarnations (who up
  until now didn't know any of this, but now Schlain does), and ending
  the system / rescuing Sariel (or trying to).  There's also the whole
  nature of magic and divinity which *could* be covered, but that
  doesn't feel necessary to me: as much as is needed has been
  explained, a deep dive into that topic would just be filler.

  Good series.  The author knows where it's going, and clearly has
  done for a while and been able to foreshadow things, and it looks
  like everything's coming to a satisfactory conclusion.

## Miscellaneous

This week I got a third monitor: a Dell U2722D Ultrasharp.  Now I have
one portrait and two landscape, all 1440p.  The second portrait
monitor is mostly going to be useful for reading things, so I can have
more documents or pages open and visible at once.

I'm still getting used to it, and working out exactly what goes on
which monitor, but I've wanted this for a while now, and it's nice to
finally have it.
