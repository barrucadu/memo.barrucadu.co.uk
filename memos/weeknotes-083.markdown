## Work

This was a four-day week due to Easter Monday, and I went on support
on Wednesday so I only had one day of normal work.  It seems that I'll
be doing a lot of support in the future, as the rota is drawing
exclusively from my team (which is admittedly a fairly large team) for
the foreseeable future, because other teams are working on more urgent
projects.

It's been a fairly relaxing few days on support, though.  I wonder if
people are submitting fewer support tickets because they imagine we're
snowed under with coronavirus work.


## The Plague

Flour has, perhaps, started to return to the shelves.  One day I was
able to buy rye flour and wholemeal flour.  No white bread flour yet
but hope has been kindled.


## Miscellaneous

### Books

This week I read [Battle Royale][] and re-read [The Book of Tea][].
Two books with Japanese themes but very different tones.

### Games

On Saturday, we had our second session of [FAE for Pokemon][], which
we switched to from the unofficial Pokemon RPG system.  We didn't
spend that much time talking about mechanics, we were mostly able to
just get on and play, which is good.  In the previous system we had to
look things up all the time.  The GM was even able to improvise a
random encounter, which has never happened before.  Fate points are
proving to be a good way to introduce fun complications into the game.

On Sunday, I ran a second game of Golden Sky Stories, and the players
enjoyed it.  One of them said they had to mute themselves from
laughing at one point, which is great feedback.  The players seemed
more engaged this time, showing narrative initiative a bit more, so I
think they're getting the hang of it.  For next week's session I'll
have to write my own story, as there are only two in the core rulebook
(or I'll buy one of the supplements).

I've started writing a [Mythras][] low-fantasy setting based on Sumer
around 2500 BC.  Here's the pitch:

> This is a low-fantasy setting inspired by real-world Sumer around
> 2500 BC, the bronze age.  Sumer is a collection of city-states in
> Mesopotamia united by a common culture.  The cities of Uruk in the
> south and Kish in the north have grown powerful and influential,
> with other city-states flocking to their banners.  The nation of
> Elam to the east, an old enemy of the Sumerians, has finished
> licking its wounds from the last war, and another looks likely.
>
> But everything changed when Ki-Asag appeared.
>
> In the year 2460 BC, the Sumerians were stunned to see the western
> desert flower and become filled with life.  But this was no divine
> miracle, the fertile new lands were an affront to the senses.
> Colours are too vibrant.  Sounds too clear.  Time seems to flow
> differently.  The best outdoorsmen become lost.  And not long after
> it appeared, the attackers came.  Tall, thin, men with pointed
> faces; wielding powers the priests cannot explain, and weapons the
> warriors cannot overcome.  The Sumerians named this land Ki-Asag,
> the place of demons.
>
> The campaign begins in the year 2450 BC, ten years after the advent
> of Ki-Asag.

I won't get to run this for months (even if my players are up for it),
as Apocalypse World is still far from a conclusion, but I'm having fun
researching and writing.  Medieval Europe is too overdone.

I also wrote a memo on [game systems][].
