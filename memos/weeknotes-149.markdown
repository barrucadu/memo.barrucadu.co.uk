## Work

I took this week off.  It would be nice to not *need* to work again
but, sadly, I'm not financially independent.


## Books

This week I read:

- Volume 6 of [Black Wings of Cthulhu][], edited by S. T. Joshi

  Another good collection of new Weird Fiction, and the last in the
  Black Wings series so far.  This was the most consistently-good
  collection in the series, with none I didn't enjoy.  I think my
  favourite three were:

  - **The Gaunt** by Tom Lynch

    In which the narrator returns to his old home of Arkham after a
    seven-year absence, which he left after his wife and daughter were
    wrongfully convicted and executed for witchcraft.  His planned
    revenge is ready.

  - **Missing at the Morgue** by Donald Tyson

    In which a murderer is killed, but the reporter who goes to take
    his picture at the morgue learns of another story: body parts are
    going missing at night.  The police put a guard at the door, but
    it's not enough.  And one night our brave narrator hides under a
    body bag overnight waiting to see the thief.

  - **Provenance Unknown** by Stephen Woodworth

    In which the narrator is sent to determine if a historical
    meteorite first found in Antarctica is the genuine article.
    Convinced it is, she buys it for herself and not her agent, but
    then learns that there's more than just rock in there.

## Gaming

This has been a good week for games.  I ran two sessions of Call of
Cthulhu, and then another of Troika.

I'd not run Troika for this group before, so it was good that we were
able to create characters and get playing quickly; the system is nice
and simple.  It went well, and everyone had a lot of fun.

I based the session on the Traveller scenario [Rule of Man
Commemorative][], in which the PCs are approached and asked to take a
collection of antique coins to a third party.  The sender doesn't want
to send the coins through the post in the normal way as they don't
want to declare the contents of any packages, because the coins have
to be transported discretely: hence, they need a patsy to carry them
as "personal items".  I also took some elements from RuneQuest
(plant-based elves), fiction (Michael Moorcock's [Dancers at the End
of Time][] in particular), the scenario in the Troika rulebook, and
also just whatever weird things I came up with on the spot.  The
players really bought into the weirdness and helped bring it to life.

## RPG Blog

Since I've been studying the Traveller rulebooks to learn the system
over the past month, learning a new system has been on my mind a lot.
So I wrote a post about [how to learn a new RPG system][].  Or at
least, how *I* learn a new RPG system.

In brief: skim through the book, practice making some characters, read
the book more carefully, run a one-shot, make cheatsheets, and then
run that campaign.
