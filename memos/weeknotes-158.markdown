## Work

The highlight of this week is that our "returning to work" plans[^rtw]
have now changed to "maybe March", which is better than the "maybe
September" we had previously.  I'm in no rush to start commuting
again.

[^rtw]: Yes, they've said "returning to work", not "returning to the
  office", as if we haven't been working for the last 18 months...

On the authentication front, this week I got [vectors of trust][]
([RFC 8485][]) mostly implemented, after doing a bunch of refactoring
and simplification of how we previously handled differing levels of
authentication.  I just need the other team to confirm that I'm using
the right query param, and then I can merge it and we'll be one step
closer to the migration being done.

There's not much left to go now.  There were meetings about the two
big outstanding topics (user migration and cookie consent), and we
have a path forward for those.  I don't think there are any unknowns
remaining, just a series of tasks to complete over the next month.
Unless something unexpected comes up, I think we're in a petty good
place.

I've also been helping out with a new GOV.UK ITHC (IT Healthcheck;
pentest).  We have these quarterly, and I helped out with the previous
one too.  I think there were plans to rotate the responsibility, but
that's not happened yet.

## Books

This week I read:

- [Forge of Darkness][] by Steven Erikson, the first of the [Kharkanas Trilogy][].

  It's been really great to get back into some High Fantasy, and to
  learn more about the origins of the Malazan world.  While reading
  the book I had a lot of difficulty figuring out the *geography*: it
  takes place in Kurald Galain, but the lands of the Jaghut are only a
  few weeks away by horse, and Omtose Phellack is just one city in
  those lands.  But in the main series, Kurald Galain and Omtose
  Phellack are Elder Warrens, and not so easily connected that you can
  just walk between the two.

  I think the answer is that the story takes place around the time of
  the birth of the warrens, and so these ancient places have not yet
  become the magical realms present in the main series.  Towards the
  end of the book, magic starts to run more rampant, with the opening
  of the Gate of Darkness (and, in response, other gates), and the
  beginning of Hood's crusade against death (which, as we know from
  the main series, will ultimately end with him as god of death).  So
  I expect the rest of the trilogy to be not just the origin story of
  the Tiste subraces, but also the origin story of the warrens and the
  first gods.

## RPG Blog

I forgot to mention it here at the time, but earlier this month I posted an
article on [dice rolls in Traveller][].

## Miscellaneous

My oven stopped working this week.  On Monday I was cooking something,
and suddenly the main breaker cut out, plunging my flat into darkness.
I wandered around with a torch, turning everything off, then flipped
the breaker and gradually turned everything back on.  Nothing seemed
obviously broken.

Then on Tuesday I discovered that, while the oven *turned on*, it
didn't *heat up*.  I didn't realise on Monday because it was still hot
enough to finish cooking my jacket potato.  So I got in touch with the
letting agency to deal with it.

They were impressively quick, I got a phone call on Wednesday morning,
and by the end of the day had arranged for a new oven to be installed
on Friday afternoon (because they no longer made spare parts for my
old oven).

I guess this is one of the advantages of renting: if something breaks
I just need to send an email, I don't need to actually go out and buy
replacement appliances myself.  Though, on the other hand, this is the
first broken appliance in all my years of renting, so the convenience
doesn't really feel worth the extra cost.
