## Work

I learned something this week: show demos more often!  I gave a short
demo after standup of a feature which I didn't think was *that*
interesting, but all the non-technical members of the team were very
impressed.  I guess it's hard to get a sense of what's going on from
short verbal updates when the topic isn't in your discipline.


## Books

I've continued reading [Tales of the Dying Earth][], by Jack Vance.
It's a strange book.  Strange but good.  It feels like typical fantasy
much of the time, but science and magic have been blurred so much that
one moment a magician will be talking about smoke demons sent to spy
on them, the next they'll be talking about growing people in vats.
It's a nice change to the usual sword-and-sorcery or epic fantasy I
read.

I also ordered a bunch more books, mostly fiction, some RPG rulebooks.
They should be arriving in the next few weeks.

## Miscellaneous

This month I've been recording things I throw away which are neither
recyclable nor compostable.  I've learned that a lot of plastic films
and other thin soft plastic packaging is not recyclable, which is a
shame because it's so often used for things like fresh fruit and
vegetables!  I'll have to keep an eye out and see if I can get less of
it.

I made some hot sauce out of finger chillies, red onions, garlic, and
dried apricots that I'd had fermenting for 11 days.  It turned out
pretty well!  The sweetness of the apricots nicely complements the
spiciness of the sauce.  Definitely a recipe to remember.

And finally, I've added some new papers to my [Interesting Research][]
memo.
