## Ph.D

- I wrote up a document briefly saying how I met all the mandatory
  corrections, [as suggested by my supervisor][], and it's a good
  thing I did because I had missed out a minor one.  It was only a one
  sentence change, but still.

  So the final-final thesis and the document are with my supervisor,
  he'll get back to me at some point about with a suggestion of what
  to do next.

## Work

- I was off Monday and Tuesday, and then spent the rest of the week
  fixing minor things, like [removing a really annoying part of our
  smart-answers testsuite][].  I also spent some time planning what
  I'll be doing next week, which is firebreak: the break between
  quarters to do whatever you want, as long as it's useful.  I'm going
  to have a go at making a support rota generator, as making that is
  currently a tedious manual process.

## Miscellaneous

- I came back to an old project, a [brainfuck interpreter using LLVM
  to JIT-compile the code][].  Except it's not really a JIT, as it
  compiles the entire program before jumping into it.  I thought I
  could improve that, but it turns out my idea didn't work.  Writing a
  good JIT is hard, who'd have thought it?

- I found a nice-looking bolognese recipe, tweaked it, and [wrote it
  up][] after it turned out really well.

- I decided to look into fermentation, and have started making some
  [kombucha][].  I'm using [a nice dark tea][] for the base---a
  fermented tea to make a fermented drink---and have a few ideas for
  flavours that might go well with the earthy taste of the tea:
  unflavoured, pear, cherry, ginger, and carrot.  I'll be trying it
  daily from tomorrow, to check if it's done fermenting and ready to
  move on to the flavouring stage.
