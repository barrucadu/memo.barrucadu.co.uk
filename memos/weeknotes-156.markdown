Number #156!  The end of a third full year of weeknotes!

While some of the entries are less good than others, I think I've
found writing a brief summary of my weeks useful.  I have a pretty
poor memory, but I've never been able to establish the habit of
keeping a traditional diary.  So this slightly different public diary
format has been handy.

I don't often want to look something up from a previous entry but,
when I do, they're nice to have.  When I realised that a frequent use
of past weeknotes was to find links I'd talked about, I set up [my
bookmarks database][] to streamline that.  I also [used old entries to
recreate the bookdb database][] after it got corrupted in 2019.  I'm
sure some new use for these weeknotes will come up in the future too.

## Work

This week was pretty slow.  I finished implementing some caching
changes, and a bug fix, and opened a PR to make logging out work when
we switch to the new auth service; and that's about it.  There are a
few things I'm waiting on the auth team for and, when they progress,
I'll be able to make some more changes on our end.

Also, we're getting a new backend developer on the team next week, so
I spent some time looking for small self-contained tasks they could
pick up to get used to our code.


## Books

This week I read:

- [Lord of Light][] by Roger Zelazny

  This book starts from the premise "what if we had a way to transfer
  minds into new bodies, and a way to grow bodies in vats, and then
  gave it to a bunch of space colonists who want to play at being
  gods?"  The result is a world where Hindu mythology is playing out,
  only the gods are real this time.

  Zelazny said that he wanted to write a book somewhere between
  fantasy and sci-fi, and so the book gives the gods powers which they
  control with their minds; but psionics is pretty old hat at this
  point, so *that* didn't really stand out to me as fantastical.  The
  way in which the story is told feels very fantasy-like but, again,
  I'd seen that before in Ilium / Olympos by Dan Simmons.

  I guess what was cutting edge in 1967 doesn't feel that
  trend-setting today.  It was still a very enjoyable book though.

## Miscellaneous

This week was my birthday.  I turned 30.

It doesn't really feel like a big deal, I didn't crumble to dust that
morning, and I don't really see the need to celebrate my birthday: my
whole life should be good, not just the occasional day here and there!

I had some family visit, which was nice, as I'd not seen them at
Christmas due to the pandemic.  I received some presents, which was
also nice.  But the fact of it being my birthday didn't really impact
the day.
