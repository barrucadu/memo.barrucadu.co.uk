## Work

I tried planning my week.  I scribbled down on my whiteboard between
one and four bullet points for every day, of things I wanted done by
then.  It worked pretty well: I got everything done, and it was
satisfying to check things off.

This week I finished off the healthcheck work [I started last week][],
helped out with our regular <abbr title="IT
Healthcheck">ITHC</abbr>[^ithc], and continued pluging away with the
implementation of [levels of authentication][].  We've shifted to
two-week sprints, because there was always stuff left over at the end
of the sprint, so we've got until the end of next week to finish off
the few remaining cards for that work.

[^ithc]: Pentest.

## Books

This week I read:

- [Helliconia][] by Brian Aldiss.

  This is a great trilogy of stories about an inhabited planet
  attached to a binary star system.  The planet has a "Great Year" of
  about 2500 Earth years, over which it changes from a frozen
  wasteland to such heat that forests burst into flames and crops
  fail.  The story primarily follows the humans of this world, and how
  their societies change during the Great Year.  It also follows an
  orbital space station built by Earth to observe Helliconia and
  populated by colonists.  To a lesser extent, it also tells the story
  of the humans of Earth, and how they change over 2000+ years.

  I really like the first two parts: Spring and Summer.  Unfortunately
  I think the last, Winter, is by far the weakest.  The story shifts
  much more towards Earth---away from Helliconia---and goes in a weird
  direction with planetary spirits (like Gaia).  It's just a very big
  change compared to the other parts.  Also it introduces this
  terrible unspeakable curse, which only the vilest of people would
  utter, and then it seems that all the highborn characters are
  yelling it every other page, making it lose any impact it may have
  had whatsoever.

## Gaming

A new player joined my Call of Cthulhu game, and as a result we moved
the session to Thursdays.  So now, for the first time in over a year,
I have free Sundays.  I'm already in talks to start another group in
that slot.


## RPG Blog

This week I published [a new post on random tables][].

> The `1d12 + 1d8` table is commonly used for random encounters,
> because it gives a nonuniform distribution where some outcomes are
> more likely than others.  But why stick to that?  By rolling one of
> the dice with advantage or disadvantage, you get a very different
> distribution, and can make one table work in many situations.
