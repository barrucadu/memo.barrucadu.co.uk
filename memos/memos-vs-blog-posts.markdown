The major differences between memos and blog posts are two: *audience* and *intent*:

- Memos are written primarily for me, to clarify something in my mind, or to record something for
  future reference.
- Blog posts are written primarily for others, to communicate something I already know and
  understand.

A few lesser differences arise consequently:

- Memos may be *updated* as I revise my understanding; whereas blog posts are typically set in
  stone.
- Memos have a much lower (effectively zero) standard of writing before publication.
- I feel less bad about using words like "thus" and "whilst" in memos, a habit my supervisor has
  tried to crush in my academic writing.
