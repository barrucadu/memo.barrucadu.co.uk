## Work

This week I spent mostly in meetings; I got a small amount of
refactoring done but that's it in terms of dev work.

We had a few story mapping sessions, and now have a good idea of
what's needed for our MVP.  Hopefully development on that can start
early next week, as we're still aiming for mid October as a launch
date, so time is slipping away...

Finally, Issy Long left GDS this week, after being there for over 6
years.  [A tribute appeared in gov.uk/humans.txt][] for Friday.

## Books

This week I read:

- [The Nun][], by Denis Diderot.

  This is the story of a nun, abused by her parents and forced into
  taking her vows unwillingly, sending her memoirs to the Marquis de
  Croismare and asking for his help in escaping from her plight.  The
  story doesn't have a very favourable depiction of convents, where
  Mothers Superior are depicted as manipulative abusers.

  The story started as a practical joke played on the real Marquis, a
  friend of Diderot's, involving an exchange of letters from a
  fictional nun; which Diderot turned into a novel afterwards.  The
  edition I have has both the novel and the letters, I found the novel
  more enjoyable than the letters, but was impressed by how kind and
  generous the Marquis revealed himself to be in his letters.

- [The Mabinogion][], translated by Sioned Davies.

  This is a collection of Welsh folktales, and trying to read all the
  Welsh names (even with a pronunciation guide at the front of the
  book) was maddening: nobody has any business being called "Hychddwn"
  or "Pwyll Pen Annwfn".  And don't get me started on King Arthur's
  shield, "Wynebgwrthucher".

  The stories portray a very different time.  In one of them Peredur,
  a knight of Arthur's court, finds a woman crying in the forest: her
  husband has just been killed by a knight.  So Peredur buries the
  husband, and goes with the woman to punish the knight.  They fight,
  the knight is defeated, and begs for mercy.  Peredur says:

  > You shall have mercy on condition that you take this woman as a
  > wife, and treat her as well as you have treated other women, since
  > you killed her husband for no reason

  The knight then "sat the woman properly on a horse beside him", and
  left.  The woman makes no comment during any of this.  Better to be
  married to your husband's killer than to be single I suppose?

I decided to buy the remnants of all the book series I'm reading: I
got all the remaining volumes of [Nana][], [Malazan][], [The
Culture][], [The Sprawl][], and a few volumes of [20th Century Boys][]
(some of the others might be out of print, so I'll need to scour the
second-hand places).  I've spent a lot of money on books this year;
maybe I can go the rest without buying any more...

## Miscellaneous

I did some pruning of my "to-read" bookmarks, I started with over a
thousand articles and papers and ended up with around 200.  I'd built
up those bookmarks over years, so it was like a trip back through time
working through them all: lots of programming and tech (including
announcements of "new" things from 2015); occasional clusters of
self-improvement, organisation, and personal finance; random articles
on things I thought were interesting at the time (like obscure
mythological creatures); and overall a gradual shift from mostly tech
to mostly game mastering.

Carefully considering so many bookmarks would have been infeasible, so
I erred on the side of deletion and only looked at each one enough to
get a sense of the overall topic.  It helped that a lot of the older
ones no longer existed (404s, inaccessible servers, or even expired
domains).  Some things I'd even bookmarked multiple times, one page I
had bookmarked 5 times over the years!  I also deleted all the papers
and books I'd bookmarked during my Ph.D, figuring that if I'd not read
them by now I probably wouldn't be reading them ever.

So now I've got a much smaller, though still fairly large, set of
browser bookmarks.  Hopefully I can keep on top of them all now, and
move things over to my [bookmarks search engine][] as I read them.
