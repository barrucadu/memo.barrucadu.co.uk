## Work

It's been a fairly quiet week.  I've been on support since Wednesday,
and all I really got done for the team before that was finishing off
the [Pact][] testing I'd started.  So now we can enable continuous
deployment for our app, yay.

Nothing major has happened on support, other than [the mimemagic gem
being yanked from RubyGems and being replaced with a GPL'd version][].
Then *that* version got yanked.  And replaced with a version which had
a bug and crashed on start-up.  And the maintainer blocked new
contributors so I couldn't report the issue.  But eventually we were
able to upgrade all our apps to a version with the fix which is MIT
licensed.

And now [a new version of Rails has been released][] dropping
mimemagic entirely.

## Books

This week I read:

- Volume 5 of [Black Wings of Cthulhu][] edited by S. T. Joshi, an anthology of modern Lovecraftian stories.

  I wasn't too impressed with this one, the earlier stories didn't
  really grip me and it seemed to take a while to get to the good
  stuff.  The ones I particularly liked were:

  - *In Bloom* by Lynne Jamneck

    Where a woman turns into a plant-person, and doesn't really mind
    at all.

  - *A Question of Blood* by David Hambling

    This takes a good Lovecraft trope---an aristocratic "well bred"
    type discovering something less-than-human in their ancestry---and
    brings it out of the distant past and into the present.  It's got
    a good *Herbert West* feel, which it quotes at the beginning.

  - *The Organ of Chaos* by Donald Tyson

    Humanity has fallen in some sort of apocalyptic event which drove
    everyone mad at the same time, and it's taken a long while for
    fully sane people to re-emerge.  They're still a minority.  The
    story follows two such sane people, travelling America trying to
    record what's out there, as they stumble upon the home town of an
    insane cult.

  I don't really like the tendency for modern Weird stories to include
  Lovecraft himself as a character.  It feels like the author is
  trying to make the story Lovecraftian by association rather than by
  actually drawing upon the themes Lovecraft himself used.

## Miscellaneous

My utility bills rose a few months ago, and rose again when I
submitted my latest readings a few days ago.  I went back through my
bills and plotted the meter readings on a graph: I've used as much gas
in the previous 3 months as I did in the 6 months before that!

Maybe my flat doesn't need to be at 22.5C *all the time...*

I think I'll take weekly readings, rather than quarterly, for a while
as I try to bring my usage back down.
