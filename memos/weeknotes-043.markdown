## Work

- It was the first week of the quarter, so there were kickoff
  meetings, and planning meetings, and finishing off some
  documentation tasks from last quarter.  Not much of this quarter's
  work got started.

- We found some documentation on the GDS wiki (which nobody ever
  reads) from some work done on improving search relevancy a few years
  ago.  It covered most of how search worked (at the time), some known
  problems, and suggestions for the future.  We updated it,
  reorganised it, and [went through a lot of iterations][] to [produce
  some documentation][].  Given the amount of change, you might wonder
  why we didn't just write it from scratch, but it was a useful
  starting point.

- We worked out some of the details of doing an A/B test comparing
  Elasticsearch 5 and 6, and I [did some of the set-up work][] for the
  test.  We're hoping that this will be the first of several A/B tests
  this quarter, all aimed at improving our search algorithm.  How
  GOV.UK runs A/B tests [is covered in our docs][].

- I got a new line manager, because my previous one is leaving GDS.

- I'm off all of next week, and will be in York for my Ph.D graduation
  on Wednesday and Thursday.

## Miscellaneous

- I finished reading [The Historian][] (by Elizabeth Kostova) which I
  started [a couple of weeks ago][].  It was good, I thought the
  story-telling mechanism of having a narrator mixing their direct
  experiences along with relaying stories, letters, and other records
  they found worked well.  The author has a couple of other books,
  which I might check out.

- I've started re-reading [The Lathe of Heaven][] (by Ursula K. Le
  Guin), about a man forced to see a psychiatrist for his drug abuse,
  and he's abusing drugs because he believes that his dreams change
  reality.

- I've been playing a lot of [Guild Wars 2][] lately.  I've been
  playing on-and-off since it launched in 2012, coming back to try out
  new things.  I've still not finished playing through the stuff from
  the [Heart of Thorns expansion][], which came out in 2015, so I've
  been gradually working my way through all that.

- I'm still using Firefox, and have just about got used to the
  differences from Chrome now.  Shortcuts keep tripping me up, but
  I've mostly got over fonts looking weird.
