## Work

It's been another week of much programming, lots has been done, and
the list of things remaining to do ever shrinks.  We walked through
the application with the whole team, and noted things down like "this
feature doesn't work quite right", or "this page doesn't look quite
right", and have been mostly working off this "snag list" this week.
There are a couple of things big enough to merit their own cards,
rather than just being entries in the list, but not many.

I'm going on support for a week on Wednesday, so I'm hoping we can get
all the complicated bits done by then.


## Books

This week I read:

- [Excession][] by Iain M. Banks, the fifth of the [Culture series][].

  A really powerful and bizarre artefact appears... and it's used as
  the *excuse* to cause a lot of problems, without actually causing
  that many itself.  Even super-intelligent AIs which live for
  thousands of years can't help but jump at the opportunity to get one
  over on those they disapprove of it seems.

  This is the last of the Culture books I'd read previously, so
  everything is new after this point.

## Miscellaneous

My network rebuild is finally complete!  Well, other than finishing
the memo about it and putting away a bunch of spare cable ties, cage
nuts, and so on.  But everything is all set up and functioning.  I'll
save more details for the memo.
