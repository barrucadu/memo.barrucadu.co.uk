## Work

This section's a bit light because I'm currently having internet
issues (which, oddly, are breaking everything *but* SSH) so I can't go
and see what I did this week.  So:

- I was on support for Monday and Tuesday.
- On, I think, Thursday we switched to working remotely by default.
- I went back to search on Wednesday, and spent the next few days
  reviewing and finishing off work left by people who had left the
  team.


## The Plague

It's been an interesting week.  The advice changed from, effectively,
"don't worry about it too much, just wash your hands and be careful"
to "stay at home unless it's really necessary."  I'm not going to
pretend to have looked into the scientific advice behind that change
(and it would be inappropriate for me to criticise it anyway) but,
needless to say, it seems to have caught a lot of people by surprise
and caused some panic.

GDS started saying "you should take your laptops home with you" on
Monday, and switched to "you should work from home" a couple of days
later.  I went to the office on Thursday to collect a package, and it
was eerily empty.

The panic buying has been a pain.  I've been trying to buy meatballs
for three days now, Tesco has been ransacked every time I've visited.
Hopefully the that'll calm down soon.  About the only thing people
*aren't* panic buying is fresh fruit, so at least I'm being healthy.

One unforeseen effect of being at home all day is that I'm drinking
*so much* oat milk.  I started buying it a while ago to make fruit
smoothies, but I think I like it as a drink by itself more than
regular milk.


## Miscellaneous

### Books

I read volume 11 of [Overlord][], and now need to wait until June for
the next one to be available.  That's the problem with light novels:
they take a couple of hours to read, but months (or years) to be
written.

I started reading The Nyarlathotep Cycle, a collection of stories
featuring Nyarlathotep collected by Robert M. Price.  The introduction
gives a bit of theology behind Nyarlathotep, and it has some
interesting ideas I'd not really thought about before.  For example,
Nyarly is described as "the soul of the Outer Gods", which I took to
just be ominous flavour text, but Robert M. Price does a good job at
tying it into eastern mythology, and compares Nyarly to the Brahman,
the ultimate reality.  So while Azathoth is described as being the
centre of all things, and that is true in one sense, it's a *higher*
truth that Nyarly is the centre of all things, and Azathoth is just
one aspect of Nyarly that we perceive with our lesser minds (as are
all the Outer Gods, and even that which we perceive as Nyarly is not
the *true* Nyarly).  That's a much more horrifying interpretation than
it just being ominous but meaningless flavour text.

Each story in the collection has a little introduction tying it into
the others.  So far I've read:

- Alhireth-Hotep the Prophet, by Lord Dunsany
- The Sorrow of Search, by Lord Dunsany
- Nyarlathotep, by H. P. Lovecraft
- The Second Coming, by W. B. Yeats
- Silence Falls on Mecca's Walls, by Robert E. Howard
- Nyarlathotep (the poem), by H. P. Lovecraft
- The Dreams in the Witch House, by H. P. Lovecraft
- The Haunter in the Dark, by H. P. Lovecraft

And that's the end of the Lovecraft stories in this collection, the
rest are all different authors, many of whom I've not read anything
from before.

I've ordered a few more weird fiction books from Amazon, which will
hopefully be arriving next week.

### Games

I bought Two Point Hospital on Steam yesterday evening, and have now
sunk 11 hours into it.  It's a fun hospital management game which
feels fairly simple, but I keep running into problems actually getting
my hospital running smoothly.

And in this game, a "pandemic" is just a condition where people have
pans stuck to their heads.


## Link Roundup

I would have more links here, but the web isn't working for me right
now.
