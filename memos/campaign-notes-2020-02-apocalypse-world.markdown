Player characters
-----------------

* **Commander Gustav Zagan**, the hardholder.  Likes everything to be
  ordered and as it should be, and rules Apotheosis with an iron fist
  to achieve that.  He keeps the people united by scaring them with
  stories of the mutants living in the wasteland, who he portrays as
  like [Firefly-style reavers][].

* **Dodge**, the driver.  Very mercenary, and known for being able to
  get risky jobs done, for the right price.  Her other car is a tank.

* **Grigsby delBarco**, the news.  An odd figure, wears an
  old-fashioned suit and keeps to himself in his radio shack,
  broadcasting "Technical Difficulties", his show.  Fancies himself a
  playwright, and tries to write moral plays; but they're always
  slightly off.  Has a prosthetic throat which crackles with static,
  makes it sound like he's always speaking over the radio, and
  prevents him from eating solid food.

* **Leah Morrel**, the savvyhead.  Laid claim to a hangar, which she
  uses as her workshop, and is secretly constructing a WWII-era plane
  in.  Lives in the radio shack with **Grigsby delBarco**.

* **Oi**, the child-thing.  Ambiguously gendered[^pronoun].  Travels
  the wastes to avoid the Wolves, and is currently living in the attic
  of the radio shack in Apotheosis.  Called "Oi" because that's what
  people shout after her.

* **Ruby Monsoon**, the battlebabe.  Often found in bars, drinking and
  playing with her seemingly endless collection of knives.  Has a
  friendly rivalry with **Dodge**.

[^pronoun]: But I'm going to use female pronouns because "they" and
  "them" get really awkward.

The Setting
-----------

### The Apocalypse

Nobody knows what happened, but they do know the effects.  The world
is as it was, mostly, but all the rain is acid, and heavy downpours
are common.  You don't want to get caught out in one of those without
protection, and you *definitely* don't want to drink the untreated
water.

Some plants and animals have adapted biologically, becoming resistant
to the acid.  Others live in shelter their entire lives.  Those which
could do neither have died off.  The acid-adapted plants and animals
can be eaten, but they don't taste good.

Some humans have adapted too, becoming the mutants living out in the
wastes.  They have varying degrees of mental acuity: some are almost
human, others are little more than feral beasts.  They tend to live in
small groups, the more human ones form camps, the more feral ones form
hunting packs.

Zagan portrays them all as mindless monsters, to unite the people of
Apotheosis with a shared fear and loathing.

### The Hold

Apotheosis[^name] itself is an old military air base which Zagan laid
claim to and built up.  Situated with the wastes to the west and other
human settlements a few miles to the east.  It mostly gets by with
raiding other settlements, both human and mutant.  Some hunting,
scavenging, and crude farming fill the gaps.

[^name]: Also known as Hope City.

It's a large base, with between 75 and 150 people living there at any
time, there's not been an accurate count done in a while.  It's
well-armed too, with both weapons and specialised battle vehicles.
Zagan keeps order with his gang of 40 savage bastards, who he somehow
keeps control of, for now...

Food and other resources are rationed, with everyone getting what they
need.  For more special fare, bullets serve as the *de facto*
currency, both within Apotheosis itself and in the wider world.

### The Environs

To the west is the wastes.  Rocky, hilly, and barren; inhabited by
mutated animals and men, adapted to deal with the toxic water.
Occasionally Apotheosis sends out squads to cull the mutant camps.

To the east is Malice, a town which was occupied by various disunited
gangs.  It was Apotheosis' prime raiding target, as no one group was
strong enough to stand up to it.  But, some weeks ago, a new boss
arrived in town, and united the gangs under one rule.  Now they're a
force to be reckoned with.

To the south is Mistfield Farm, a small religious community who supply
food to Apotheosis in exchange for protection.  Zagan engineered this
relationship by showing up just in the nick of time to save the
faithful from a band of raiders, what a nice guy.  What they don't
know is that Zagan enticed the raiders in the first place.


Session 0, 2020-02-29
---------------------

<aside class="highlight">
This was a short session to get some establishing shots of the
characters.
</aside>

It's a fine morning with no current acid rain, though it has rained
overnight.

Zagan is out supervising repair works on the fence, which was damaged
in a recent mutant raid.  The workers are very organised, with no
arguments or brawling, just getting on with the task.  As he likes it.

*Meanwhile...*

Leah wakes up in her messy bedroom in the radio shack, atop the pile
of clothes she uses for a bed.  She's not been living there for long,
only a few months; maybe a year at most.  She goes out into the
kitchen and rummages through the fridge for some breakfast: a
delicious can of spam, hiding at the back, behind the tubes of
Grigsby's weird nutrient paste.  As she opens the can, she becomes
aware of the crackle of static, and turns around to see Grigsby.  Leah
chucks him a food-paste-tube and eats her disgusting spam.

When she's done with it, a cupboard opens and Oi peeks out.  "You
gonna use that?"  Leah shakes her head and passes the can to Oi, who
disappears out the front door and scrambles up the front of the
building.  Leah looks in the cupboard Oi came from: there's no obvious
hidden entrance.

Leah decides to go to the warehouse to get some parts for her project:
she's been building a WWII-era plane in her workshop, and it's nearly
done.  She's been stealing parts to work on it, but is worried people
have started to catch on.  Got to play it honest from now on and just
get parts legitimately.  All she needs now is an engine, and she can
go flying through the sky, free of this place.  She doesn't want Zagan
to know about the plane though, as he'll come up with some nasty
military use for it.

The warehouse is the domain of Foster, the quartermaster.  Harsh and
inflexible, but he'll give you what you want as long as you're not
taking more than your fair share.  He's Zagan's man to a T.  As Leah
is negotiating with Foster for an engine---*just* an engine, she
doesn't want word getting out that she's looking for a *plane
engine*---Zagan himself shows up, drinking a cup of cheap instant
coffee.  Well, it was cheap, in the old days, now it's a luxury item,
and he sends out raiding parties just to stock up.

Zagan's arrival unnerves Leah, but he doesn't talk.  He just watches
her go get the engine, and stagger out the warehouse back towards her
hangar.  When she's half way there he hands his mug to Foster, in much
the same way you'd put it down on a table, and strides after her.
"Need a hand?"  She thanks him, but he follows anyway, only turning to
go after she's inside the hangar.

*Meanwhile...*

Ruby and Dodge wake up in the bar, in a pile of empty cans and
discarded peanut shells.  There's nobody else there.  Ruby got back
last night from a secret mission for Zagan---getting more coffee---and
the first thing she did was challenge Dodge to a drinking contest.
She groans, and heads off to deliver her secret package, though
Grigsby's voice over the radio is now saying "Folks, rumour has it
that a new shipment of coffee arrived in Apotheosis today!"

Dodge is still struggling to move when Dinnerlady, the man who runs
the bar and canteen, arrives to set up for the day.  "You look like
shit, go clean up." He throws a packet of peanuts to her and starts
polishing glasses.

*That evening...*

Oi stands on the roof of the warehouse, as she often does, looking out
across the waste.  She opens her mind, trying to sense the
Wolves... and knows instantly that one is to the east, a few miles
away.

A few minutes later, Zagan hears Oi's voice through the panels of his
ceiling warning him to watch out for "them".  Oi has spoken to him
like this before, but she's never shown herself.


Session 1, 2020-03-14
---------------------

It's a wet afternoon here in Apotheosis.  It's been raining pretty
heavily for the past few days, and so people have been keeping
indoors.  Now that it's cleared up, people are emerging from their
homes, some are going 'round inspecting the buildings for any damage,
their thick boots squelching in the acidic mud.

But first, it's time for Grigsby's broadcast:

> Hello, Listeners.

> That was, of course, *Frank Sinatra: The World We Knew*.

> In Frank's world, stars are signs to be read and the sun and moon

>
> Here's one for the little baby mutant, *The Ink Spots: It's All Over
> but the Crying*.

Commander Zagan paces back and forth in his office, concerned by the
food situation in Apotheosis.  Supplies are running low.  He sends a
man to fetch Grigsby, to see if his informants have heard any rumours
of new targets.

A little later, Grigsby arrives, pausing in the corridor outside the
waiting room; Miss Vine, Zagan's weird creepy secretary is there,
making some coffee at her desk.  He composes himself, and tries to
walk through the room to the office door without acknowledging her or
drawing her attention at all.  Unfortunately for him, she looks up at
him, she looks up *through* him, and says "the commander is expecting
you, Grigsby, I'll check if he's ready."

Zagan hears a knocking, and opens his door.  It's Miss Vine, holding
his coffee, with Grigsby anxiously standing behind her.  He takes the
coffee and invites Grigsby in.  Grigsby presses against the doorframe,
trying to squeeze through as far from Miss Vine as he can get.

With the door shut, Grigsby calms down, and looks around at the office
for anything that's changed since he was last here.  There's just one
thing, a small golden figure of a bull.  Following his gaze, Zagan
comments that Dodge picked it up on a recent raid.  They make some
small talk.  Neither have seen a bull in real life.  "It's hard to
imagine what they used such small creatures for," one says, assuming
it's life-sized.

Zagan then gets to the point.  Because he and Grigsby have some
history, he can be very frank about the situation.  Apotheosis is not
in a good place right now, and if demand keeps up as it has... well,
best not to think about that.  Grigsby says that one of his informants
is due to report in later in the day, and he's expecting a tip about a
new settlement.  But there's a price: he wants to be paid, and he
wants the new mutant-baby to live.

Bad then turns to worse as one of the gardeners, Balls, shows up with
the news that a greenhouse got damaged in the storm, and the rain
killed a bunch of the crops.

Zagan and Grigsby argue back and forth a bit, and eventually settle on
Grigsby being paid, and Zagan being noncommittal about the baby.
"Well, *I* won't order anything done, but I may not have as tight a
rein on my men as you seem to think...."  he says.

*Meanwhile...*

Leah goes over to her workshop for the first time in days, to find the
padlock smashed clean off the door.  Someone broke in and they weren't
subtle about it.  She carefully opens the door, looking and listening
for anyone inside.  She edges over to the light switch, and flicks it
on...

Nothing happens.

But something *has* happened: three of the jeeps have been smashed up
pretty bad.  Fortunately it looks all cosmetic---dented bodies and
broken windows---and these weren't the prettiest of vehicles to start
with.  The plane is fine.

"That's pretty damaged," Oi says, appearing out of nowhere.  She
didn't see what happened.

Leah decides to open her mind to the maelstrom and try to sense what
happened.  It's normally a calm experience: there's a sensation of
freefall, then exhilaration as she soars through a blue sky.  Perhaps
this is where she got the idea to make the plane from.  She feels
strong emotions, senses a voice, and sees someone holding a hammer.
It's Newton, a scrawny little twerp who's been watching her lately.
Seems he's got a crush and doesn't know how to express it, but it's
gone way too far now.

Newton lives somewhere in the dorms, so she heads off to find him, Oi
in tow.

Unlike many of the buildings in Apotheosis, which have been adapted
from their original purpose, the dorms were clearly built as dorms.
But now they're way more densely populated than they'd been designed
for, and any spare spaces---like laundry and storage rooms---are being
used as homes.  The space between the four big buildings serves as a
kind of outdoor social space.

It takes a little hunting, but she finally finds herself outside a
door scrawled with "Newton" in some sort of paint.  She knocks on the
door, sees the peephole darken and then lighten again as if someone
briefly looked through it.  The door doesn't open.  "Hey Newton, I
know you're in there!" she yells as she bangs on the door.

Eventually it opens a crack, and a scrawny little guy, mid teens at
most, peers out at her.  It's Newton.  At first he feigns ignorance
but, under her continued stare and verbal harangue, eventually gives
in and admits "I just wanted to be noticed".  The door swings open a
little wider, and he passes the hammer to Leah.  "Don't ever let me
catch you back at my workshop again!"

*Later...*

Grigsby is sat in the shack, at the appointed time.  On the door
sounds the appointed knock.  Grigsby opens it, to reveal Dune, one of
his informants.  They talk a bit about the situation in Malice,
"almost nobody's seen the new boss, but rumour says he's not very big
or tough looking... but something about him scares people, and they do
what he says."  Then they move onto the topic of a new farm, Mistfield
Farm, which a bunch of religious nuts started to the south.  It's been
there for about a month now, and they're preparing fields for crops.
Grigsby decides this is just the sort of thing Zagan is looking for.

*Later...*

Zagan, Dodge, and some of the thugs are driving south to the farm.
Since she's got company, Dodge gets out the *fancy* whisky for this
trip, offering some to Zagan, then taking a swig for herself, without
taking her eyes off the road.  Much.

It's not long before they get their first sight of Mistfield Farm:
wooden buildings, outdoor fields---that's unusual, people normally use
greenhouses---covered by a makeshift gazebo and surrounded by a ditch
to catch the rain, and a few people doing construction or working in
the fields.  One man approaches as they pull up.  He introduces
himself as Brother Grome and, after learning who they are and where
they came from, asks what their visit is for.  Zagan wastes no time in
getting to it: he wants them to supply Apotheosis with food.  In
exchange, they'll protect the farm from raiders, who will certainly be
coming once word of an undefended food source gets out.

Brother Grome doesn't really see the point.  They've been here for a
month now without being bothered and, besides, they have God on their
side.  What do they have to fear?

Zagan sees that they're getting nowhere, makes his excuses, and the
gang head back to Apotheosis.

*Back in Apotheosis...*

Zagan shows up at the radio shack, and has Grigsby mention the farm in
his next broadcast.  Not exactly *telling* people that it's undefended
and would be a good target, but certainly hinting it.

*That evening...*

Leah checks the storehouse again for a plane engine, in case one has
come in in the last few days.  But there's still nothing.  So she goes
to find Dodge.

Dodge is in the bar, which is called The Rattlesnake, surrounded by
empty glasses, bottles, cans, and packets of peanuts as usual.  Leah
carefully broaches the subject, saying that this has to be kept a
secret from Zagan, "sure, it's not like I tell that guy everything,
what's up?"

Dodge has a few likely places she can check for an engine, and all she
wants as payment is to have a go at flying it.  And what Zagan doesn't
know won't hurt him.

*Meanwhile...*

Oi is in her lair, the attic and ventilation pipes of the radio shack.
She's listening to a radio that only she can hear, which speaks about
another world.  Satisfied with what she has heard, she leaves her lair
and goes to the store.  She's noticed, but nobody says anything to
her.  After looking around a bit, she finds what she's looking for:
some discarded packaging material.  She takes some string, and returns
to her lair.

She eats the string, and feels happy.

*A few days later...*

An orange flare is seen to the south: the signal, sent by one of
Zagan's men left behind, that there are raiders approaching the farm.
Apotheosis sets forth with a small gang in tanks.  Almost everyone is
along for the ride: Zagan and Dodge and leading the charge, Grigsby is
there with a portable radio kit to broadcast that the farm is now
under Apotheosis protection, and Leah is there in case any repairs are
needed.

They arrive to find six raiders terrorising the farm.  Some buildings
are on fire, there's been fighting, and crates of supplies are being
carried off as the religious nuts protest.  Apotheosis forces, which
outnumber the raiders, advance and start to take control of the
situation.

It looks pretty safe now, so Leah gets out of her tank to fix some
damaged tread but while she's distracted doing that, a seventh raider
sneaks up and grabs her, holding a gun to her head.  He yells to "call
off your men, or I'll shoot!"

Zagan pops his head out of his tank and keeps the man talking while
his troops capture the others.  He then says "now run off and tell any
of your other friends that this place is under my protection!"  The
raider quickly glances behind himself, backs up some more, then shoves
Leah forward and runs off.

This time, Zagan doesn't have any difficulty convincing Brother Grome
that they need his protection.  He has Grigsby broadcast a message
that if you mess with Mistfield Farm you mess with Apotheosis, and
gives some flare guns to Brother Grome to signal Apotheosis with if
they're attacked again.


Session 2, 2020-03-28
---------------------

Last time, Apotheosis faced a potential food crisis, but Grigsby and
Commander Zagan used their twisted minds to threaten a religious
commune into supplying food to Apotheosis in exchange for protection.
Also, Dodge agreed to help Leah find a plane engine, for the low price
of letting her fly it, at least a few times.  And Oi ate some string.

But first, it's time for Grigsby's broadcast:

Grigsby eyes Leah over breakfast.  He know's she's up to something.

*Flashback to the night before, Grigsby reviewing his security camera
footage and seeing Leah's comings and goings.*

He can smell a story, and wants to get involved.  But when asked, she
just deflects the question, poorly, and escapes outside.  Grigsby
follows, and sees her meeting with Dodge, "I think Grigsby suspects
something" "that you're going to Malice?"

Grigsby steps out of the shadows, "you're going to Malice, you say?
Mind if I come along?  I'd like to investigate the new boss out that
way."

Leah panics.  Dodge tells him to fuck off.  A brief negotiation later,
the three are on the road to Malice, Grigsby having handed over some
oddments in payment.  Dodge likes fast cars and fast music, and puts
the latter on, loudly.

*Meanwhile...*

Ruby is outside Apotheosis, near the entrance, doing some target
practice.  Next to her is a small, but growing, pile of small dead
animals.  A hairless and deformed fox scurries out of the undergrowth.
She splits its head open.  More meat.

A man approaches, walking down the Malice road.  He's kind of thin,
medium height, and wearing a thick yellow hooded cloak.  In the
distance behind him, clouds start to gather.  He stops a little short
of the entrance, looking between Ruby and the guards, and loudly asks
if he can have leave to enter.  Ruby ignores him.  One of the guards
goes to fetch Commander Zagan.

*Meanwhile...*

Commander Zagan is showing around a newly-arrived family, bragging
about all the fantastic amenities Apotheosis has: running water,
rationed spam, dry beds.  A veritable paradise.

The guard arrives, and whispers his errand in the commander's ear.
Zagan makes his apologies to the family, and sits them down to watch
an educational film about Apotheosis: bits of tape from pre-apocalypse
films spliced together, with new bits inserted showing old-style
silent film dialogue cards.

Zagan arrives at the gate.  He glances at Ruby and her pile of
corpses, but keeps most of his attention on the man.  They have a
brief conversation.  The man asks if he can come in to spread "the
word of chaos", but Zagan isn't having any of that.

The storm is growing, but Zagan pushes the man out.  As a gesture of
goodwill, he gives the man a hat to protect himself.  But no preaching
in Apotheosis today.

The man sets off back down the road.

*Later...*

Ruby arrives in the Rattlesnake, and wordlessly hands over her
still-dripping bag of fresh meat.  Dinnerlady, just as wordlessly,
hands her a crate of bottles of drink and tins of food.  This is an
exchange they've performed many times before.

*At Malice...*

Dodge's jeep pulls into the junkyard.  It's close to Malice, but the
piles of crap are so high you can hide behind them.  Everyone gets out
of the car.  Oi appears from somewhere, and scrambles up a junk
mountain to keep an eye out.

Leah and Dodge get to searching.  Grigsby just hangs around.

Atop her mountain, Oi spies three men in Malice, near the junkyard.
She opens her mind to the maelstrom trying to sense if any of them are
wolves, as she knows there is one in Malice.  To her shock, there is a
wolf: it's near Apotheosis, not Malice, but it's and getting closer.
Feels like it's on the road, a few hours walk away.  Oi scrambles down
and reports her findings: "we've got to go, it's not safe!  there's
three men, and a wolf!"

Grigsby isn't scared of any wolves, but he is interested in those men.
He slips away, and approaches them.

They stop when they see him.  He greets them, saying "you may have
heard me on the radio."

"The radio station from Apotheosis?" one says.

"Ah, a fan!  I have some questions about your new boss, if you don't
mind."

"Apotheosis?  I think the boss would like to meet you, but he's out
just now, should be back later" another man says.

"Oh, well, here's my card, it's got my private radio frequency."

"No, I think the boss would really like to meet you *in person*." the
same man says, stepping forward menacingly.

"Now just you hang on there, I'm not alone!"

Grigsby manages to bluff that he has some others with him, including
the famed sharpshooter Ruby Monsoon, and they're expecting him back.
The man relents, not wanting to get into a shooting match.  He takes
the card, and they watch him go.

When Grigsby gets back to the junkyard, Dodge and Ruby found a plane
engine and are loading it into the car.  He doesn't waste any time,
"let's go!"

The car speeds off out of the junkyard and back towards Apotheosis.
On the road, in the rain, they pass a man.  A thin medium-height man
wearing a thick yellow hooded cloak, with a hat on top of the hood.
As the car speeds past, he looks up, and makes eye contact with Oi.

*That evening...*

Zagan decides to make a pre-emptive strike against Malice, destroying
their armoury.  So he got Leah to make a bomb---an unstable thing made
out of a car engine, some plastic tubing, and a bunch of colourful
liquids; it even had a key to set it off---and set off in the jeep
with Dodge, Ruby, Balls, and Dog Head.

They parked out of sight, and snuck into the town.  People roamed the
streets, and guards stood outside the armoury.  The gang crept over to
an alley next to the building, and broke a window.  Turns out Oi came
with them too, and it's too late to send her back now.

Footsteps approaching.  Ruby hid at the entrance to the alley, and
quickly dragged in the guard to peered around.  She soundlessly slit
his throat and lowered the body to the ground.

Dodge decides to see if there was anything in the armoury she wanted
before they blew it up, so she hopped in through the window.  No
car-mounted guns, sadly, but there was a grenade launcher and a sack
of grenades.  Nice!

Oi opens her mind to the maelstrom again, trying to sense the wolf
from earlier.  She senses it alright: it's nearby, and it's suddenly
aware of her.  Like when Frodo puts the Ring on in Mount Doom and
shines like a beacon to Sauron.  She clambers through the window,
"it's not safe!", opens a door, and hides beneath a desk.  After a few
minutes, Zagan coaxes her out, saying that they're leaving now.

Everyone but Dog Head sneaks back out.  He leans through the window,
ignites the bomb, drops it, and sprints out without trying to be
stealthy.  A few seconds later the building erupts: windows and doors
blown out, people on the street knocked over.  He's blown over too,
but got far enough away that he can pick himself up and keep going.
Everyone piles into Dodge's jeep, which tears away down the road, with
no attempt at stealth.

Two other vehicles start pursuing: a massive keep with metal spikes
stuck all over it, and a sleek, vintage, convertible, with three
people crammed into two seats.  Dodge tries to slam the convertible
off the road, but misjudges the distance and stops short; it slams her
instead, tearing up the side and ripping off some of the armour
plating.

Just then, Leah arrives in the APC, bouncing over a rise, slamming
into the convertible and flinging it off the road.  Its side crumpled
in, and the passengers crumpled, too.  They're not moving any time
soon.

Dodge slows down and pulls up next to the APC.  Ruby jumps to the APC.
Leah jumps in surprise.

The spiky jeep slams its brakes on, and Dodge crashes into the back of
it; the windshield, lights, and bonnet perforated.  The people manage
to avoid the spikes though.

Ruby opens fire with the APC's machine gun, pinning down the men in
the jeep.

Zagan clambers out of the busted windshield, over the other vehicle,
shoots the driver, the passenger gets one shot off but it pings off
Zagan's armour; Zagan kills him too, climbs into the jeep, and drives
it back to Apotheosis.


Session 3, 2020-04-11
---------------------

Last time, Leah got her plane engine, Grigsby got away from some
malicious men, Dodge got a grenade launcher, Ruby got a crate of
alcohol, and Gustav got to blow up an armoury.  I think that's about
it.

The radio broadcast this time was just a bulleted list of updates:

- Leah got a new engine for some sort of project she's working on.
- Roark, mentioned in the first broadcast, was promoted to Captain of
  the Defence Force and was allowed to keep his child.
- Dremmer, hitherto unmentioned, the Captain of the Suppression Force,
  started trouble again---something about not getting enough
  respect---and in the ensuing fight was put in the infirmary.

*Flashback to Roark's promotion...*

After a private meeting in his office, Zagan took Roark out for the
public celebration of his promotion.  A big stage, a big handshake,
and the presentation of a medal.  Troops gave a gun salute.  Not all
the troops had matching equipment, and some of the medals were bottle
caps, but it was as grand as Zagan could make it.

*At Mistfield Farm...*

Leah arrived at the farm, with Dog Head driving, called out to fix a
busted generator.  Brother Grome is waiting for them.

"Grome again..." says Dog Head.  Leah asks what's up: he thinks
something's wrong.  Brother Grome always seems to be around, and
somehow shows up and interrupts every time you try to talk to anyone
else at the farm.  Very strange.

Brother Grome takes them to the generator shed, explaining about how
it stopped working, and leaves Leah and Dog Head to get on with it,
but says he'll be nearby if they need him.  The generator is broken,
but Leah can fix it with a couple of hours work.

Part way through, Dog Head says "watch this", and steps out of the
shed.  Immediately Brother Grome appears and asks if they need
anything.  "No, just stretching my legs."

Dog Head suggests you two split up so that one of you can talk to the
others here, and see what's going on.  Leah asks Brother Grome where
the toilets are, he starts to say "if you'll both follow me...",
before Dog Head interrupts saying he needs to watch the generator.
Leah concurs, the flange pump needs reticulating at just the right
moment, or they'll have to start again.  Brother Grome seems
uncertain, then calls over Sister Mary to show Leah where to go.

Leah tries to engage Sister Mary in conversation, but Sister Mary
doesn't talk.  She just looks at the ground as she guides Leah.  When
Leah brings up Brother Grome, she stumbles a bit, and trembles.  She's
terrified.

When she gets back Brother Grome, the usual friendliness in his eyes
replaced with suspicion, says that he saw them talking, and asks what
they talked about.  "Oh, just talking about the farm, it's a nice
community you've got here."  The friendliness returns, and they have a
chat about what the farmers actually believe in.  The way Brother
Grome explains it, they see work as morally good, as they're
fulfilling the purpose god gave them---just like how animals fulfil
their natural purpose---and that sloth is the ultimate sin.

Leah and Dog Head finish their work and leave, deciding not to
confront Brother Grome there and then.  More investigation is needed.

*Meanwhile, at The Rattlesnake...*

Dodge sits, half slumped over her table, and spies Miss Vine arrive.
Strange to see her here.  She carefully picks her way across the room,
stepping over the drunks, the bottles, and the occasional pool of
vomit, and arrives at Dodge's table.  She says she's come for Zagan's
coffee and then, unusually for her, hesitates briefly and says "you
can be discrete, right?"

Turns out that Burns, one of the old guys living in the shacks near
the dorms, needs a job doing.  There's a package at a drop site in the
middle of nowhere which he needs fetching.  Dodge reads between the
lines to see that it's probably not a set-up: Miss Vine trusts her to
get the job done and not talk about it.  They negotiate pay, and then
Dodge goes to see Burns.

Burns, an old balding guy with a large white moustache, explains
carefully where the package is.  He says normally his grandson would
go, but the grandson died in the last raid.  He pays up front, and
Dodge sets off.  She picks up Ruby on her way out.

The site is an old highway, the surrounding ground dotted with small
craters, and the road itself crowded with abandoned vehicles.  It's
quiet.  Burns explained exactly which car the package was in, so they
find it easily.  The package is a small, impressively locked, wooden
box.  The box itself has a lock, and is wrapped in multiple padlocked
chains.  Ruby shakes it, but it's so full (or so empty) that nothing
rattles, and she can't tell anything about the contents.

Just then, three bikers show up.

Dodge and Ruby scurry back to the jeep and set off.  The bikers come
in pursuit.

Ruby leans out of the jeep window aiming the grenade launcher, but the
biker in front is faster: he gets a shot off, she drops the grenade
launcher, and falls out of the jeep, rolling along the road.  Dodge
slams on the brakes, the biker is too close and gets taken out.  A
second biker stops next to the grenade launcher and reaches for it,
but Ruby gets him to back off.  She picks it up, and gets hit in the
back by the third biker, wielding a metal pole.  Dodge drives into the
group: the bikers jump out of the way, and Ruby climbs in.  They
escape.

Back in Apotheosis, Dodge delivers the box without asking what's
inside.

*That night...*

The mutant siren goes off: there's a raid.

Grigsby is woken up by the noise, and sees his bedroom door open.
There's a figure silhouetted there.  He asks "Leah, is that you?", but
there's no response.

Leah, also woken up by the siren, groggily stumbles out of her room
and into Grigsby's.  She brushes past the unknown figure before
realising that there's someone there, and stops dead.  As she replays
the last minute in her head, she thinks how hard and metallic the arm
she touched was...

Oi wakes up, but not because of the siren; she can sleep through worse
noise than that.  Oi wakes up because she senses a wolf.  But, when
she concentrates, she realises it's not *quite* a wolf.  It's inside
the radio shack, and she scurries down from her hiding place to
investigate.

Leah puts the light on.  The figure is a tall woman, her face covered
in piercings, and a mohawk.

Grigsby starts to tell Leah off for bringing her friends to the shack
without permission, before the woman interrupts: "so you really don't
remember me, after you abandoned me to save yourself!"

Grigsby wakes up fully, and remembers.  Before Apotheosis, she was in
their group: him, Zagan, Innkeeper, and a few others.  She got
romantically involved with a mutant, which Zagan took as a threat to
his authority; even then he was using the "mutants are monsters" story
to scare people into line.  It culminated in a fight: Grigsby had his
throat torn out, and Innkeeper was left got dead.  But now she's back.

Innkeeper raises her pistol, and shoots Grigsby.  Leah tries to
intervene, but is too slow.  Grigsby reels in pain, Leah shoots
Innkeeper in the head with her shotgun, and Innkeeper... isn't too
fazed.  Her face gets scratched, like painted metal someone's taken a
key to, and one of her eyes was blown out, revealing a glowing red
machine eye beneath.

Grigsby tazes her, but she shrugs it off.

Oi drops from a ventilation shaft in the ceiling onto Innkeeper's
head, and manages to ask "what are you?" before Innkeeper flings her
to the floor.

Noticing sparking inside the eye socket, Leah decides to try
short-circuiting Innkeeper.  She grabs Grigsby's chamberpot, flinging
it in Innkeeper's face.  Innkeeper collapses to the floor, unmoving.

Oi dives on her and starts trying to pry her face off with a knife.
After a few moments, it pops off.  A metal face which looks human, but
a robot beneath.

Nobody is really sure what's going on, but Grigsby suggests that maybe
Leah could get Innkeeper working again.  "Great, another secret."

*Meanwhile...*

Roark busts into Zagan's office / bedroom, bringing the news that 15
mutants are attacking.  They're almost inside the walls.  Zagan says
to call the men, and goes to his tank.

Several minutes later, Zagan arrives at the walls in his tank, the men
arriving too.  They already outnumber the mutants, who are climbing
over the fence.  The fight breaks out.  Most mutants are killed in the
initial exchange of bullets and shells, some making it inside
Apotheosis and scattering.  Soon they're all dead, or have fled.

Zagan sends some men to follow the fleeing mutants back to their camp.
One comes back after an hour and says that there's a new camp on the
far side of a nearby hill.

Apotheosis forces set out.  The strategy is to surround the enemy:
send the foot-soldiers out behind the mutant camp, and have the
vehicles attack from the front.  Most of the mutants will run from the
firepower, and into the waiting ambush.

Battle vehicles crest the hill, and start blasting the camp.  Some of
the mutants fight back, and die.  Most run, into the waiting men, and
die.  It's a massacre.  The men laugh as they kill.

After examining the camp for supplies, it's set on fire.  The men hang
around warming themselves with the flames, talking and joking, until
it's just ash.

*The next day...*

Grigsby approaches Zagan suggesting a peace deal with Malice.  Zagan's
open to the idea, and Grigsby quickly gets the leader of Malice on the
line.

It's a voice Zagan recognises.  The voice of the man who visited
Apotheosis asking to come in to preach about chaos.  The man who Oi
sensed to be a wolf.  Ezra.

Zagan starts by mocking Ezra about blowing up their armoury: "how do
you like chaos now?"  But he's is incredibly infazed, and just says
that they can rebuild when they need to.

A deal is hammered out.  Zagan wants a superior position, but doesn't
really get it.  Ezra wants an open borders agreement, but doesn't
really get it.  They settle on a ceasefire---no raids---and access for
trade caravans.


Session 4, 2020-04-25
---------------------

Last session, Leah discovered something was up at Mistfield Farm.
Brother Grome is perhaps not the kindly man of faith he tries to
appear...  While that was going on, Dodge went on a secret mission to
fetch an impressively locked box for Burns, although it was Miss Vine
who set up the meeting.  I wonder how they're connected.  In the night
mutants attacked Apotheosis, and in the confusion Innkeeper got to
Grigsby.  The gang managed to disable her, revealing that she's some
sort of machine, and now the body is lying on a slab in the workshop.

But first, the news:

*Last night...*

Leah bandages up Grigsby, and removes Oi from Innkeeper's body.  Oi
resists, unsuccessfully.  She carries Innkeeper to the radio shack
workshop: a black and grey room; floor to ceiling tubes, wires, and
cables; electrical supplies and radio equipment scattered everywhere.
Leah wipes all the junk off one table, ignoring Grigsby's protests,
and sets Innkeeper down.  She starts examining the body.

"She's still a person," Grigsby protests.

"This person just tried to kill you."

While their arguing, Oi cuts the rest of Innkeeper's face off: it's
skin, and bleeds.  Beneath is the robot.

Leah gets in the zone to examine Innkeeper.  She sets up a bunch of
signal generators and gets them all producing the same sine wave.  She
closes her eyes, concentrates, and opens her mind to the maelstrom.
She...

...sees: two men, wearing yellow robes with a star-in-circle symbol,
looking at Innkeeper who is strapped to a surgical chair.  Through the
window is the wastes.  "A failure!"  "Throw her out to die."

...feels: Innkeeper has been in pain since those men did whatever
it is they did.

...knows: how to repair Innkeeper, and that Oi is somehow related to
Innkeeper being a failure.

Leah decides it's time to question Oi about the wolves.  She opens her
eyes, says "I know how to fix her", and sends Grigsby to make some
tea.  She begins to question Oi.

Through the interrogation, Oi reveals that the wolves are everywhere.
The symbol Leah saw is the symbol of the wolves.  Once before the
wolves found Oi and her brother, said that they were "something
special", and lowered their disguises.  In terror, she managed to flee
through the maelstrom, but she doesn't know what became of her
brother.

Oi reminds Leah that she felt a wolf in Malice: the old man they saw
walking through the rain.[^s4_wolf]

[^s4_wolf]: In an OOC discussion we realised that Grigsby is the only
  character who could have put the whole picture together (the wolf is
  the leader of Malice), as he was with Oi when she realised that the
  man was a wolf, and with Zagan he recognised the leader as the old
  man who had come to the gates of Apotheosis previously.  We decided
  Grigsby would overhear the end of the conversation, and share his
  revelation with Leah and Oi.

*After the news broadcast...*

Leah is telling Grigsby about her experience on Mistfield Farm, and
something seemed wrong.  Grigsby, sensing a story, decided to try to
divine what was going on by opening his mind to the maelstrom.

For Grigsby, the maelstrom is like an infinite number of overlapping
radio broadcasts.  Words, words, words.  No other senses, just the
words.  He repeated "this place is a lie" in his head as a mantra, and
felt himself drawn to Mistfield.  He felt that Sister Mary was afraid,
and that somewhere near her was intense anger.

*Meanwhile...*

Dodge pulls up to her clinic / drug lab.  It's a bunker with a buried
entrance, and there's other ruins scattered around.  Someone coming
through the immediate area would see the car and be curious, but
someone seeing it from a distance would think it's just another relic
of the past.  She waves at Mox and Bones.

Mox is mushing up some plants with a mortar and pestle, says it'lol
probably kill even Dodge, but he offers her a different bowl
containing an almost identical-looking plant mush, saying that's the
good stuff.

Bones is working on his map.  Suddenly, a radio starts broadcasting
Grigsby's voice: describing all the new places that listeners have
sent in.  Bones didn't ask Grigsby for help, and doesn't like him
much.  Grigsby also didn't ask, he just assumed his help would be
welcome.  After a while, Bones switches the radio off mid-sentence.

*Meanwhile...*

Zagan isn't happy.  Word's got out that someone snuck in to Apotheosis
and attacked Grigsby last night, and people are getting riled up.
They're keeping indoors, peering out their doors and windows, and
people outdoors travel in groups, weapons on display.

The lock to the radio shack has been smashed off.  He picks it up,
pockets it, and knocks.

Grigsby appears, acting unconvincingly casual as he holds the bandage
over his chest, and comes up with some lame excuse for the injury---he
got stabbed by a metal rod in a piece of radio equipment or something
like that.

Zagan pushes his way inside, and looks around.

He goes into the workshop and whisks aside a curtain, revealing
Innkeeper.

Grigsby tries to explain... ultimately giving up and saying "Leah
knows more."

*Later...*

Zagan shows up at the hangar to talk to Leah.  The door is locked, but
he shoots the lock off, and steps inside.

Leah is working on the plane she's been keeping secret.

"Gustav, I can explain..." she begins, before being cut off.

"I need your help to deal with the robots."

He ignores the plane, and asks what she knows.  Leah repeats what Oi
told her, and says that the wolves could be coming for Oi.  She also
shares Grigsby's realisation that the leader of Malice is a wolf.
Zagan takes all this strange stuff in his stride, and asks what she
would advise.  Leah suggests throwing a party to celebrate the trade
deal, getting the leader drunk or drugged, and examining him.

Zagan then looks around until he finds Dodge, and asks her to use her
drug lab[^s4_lab] to make something to knock out a robot, and to ask
Leah if she needs help.  Dodge gets Mox involved, who says he'll do
his best, but he can't really judge how effective it'll be without a
patient to test it on beforehand.

[^s4_lab]: Zagan knows Dodge has a drug lab, but not where it is.

*Meanwhile...*

Grigsby reaches out through his trading contacts, and buys a powerful
signal generator from an electronics merchant in Malice.  A powerfuls
ignal generator and a faraday cage are the two components Leah needs
to bring Innkeeper back.

*Even later...*

The gang gather in Zagan's office, to say that something doesn't seem
right with Mistfield Farm and they should look into it.  Zagan agrees,
thinking that, if there is something wrong, solving it would make
Mistfield even more indebted to Apotheosis.

They decide to head down.

Brother Grome is slightly taken aback by so many people arriving at
once, and Zagan immediately takes over the scene: striding confidently
ahead and looking around, asking questions about the farm and the
people, forcing Brother Grome to almost jog to keep up.

Oi slips off, and goes to the furthest shed out from the main
settlement.  It's locked, but she smashes it open with a rock.

Inside is a woman, beaten and bloody, on the floor in chains.  She
weakly looks up.  It's Sister Mary.

Just as Oi frees Sister Mary and starts to think about an escape
route, a hand clamps down on her shoulder: "what are you doing here?"

It's one of the other Brothers.  He locks her up in a different shed,
after confiscating her waterproofs.


Session 5, 2020-05-09
---------------------

Last session, we got some good plot development about the wolves!
Leah learned that Innkeeper was turned into what she was by the
wolves, though they considered her a failure only good enough to die
in pain.  They have a base somewhere out in the wastes where they
carry out their nefarious purposes.  Not only that, the wolves tried
to take Oi when she was younger, they said she had "something
special"—Oi escaped, but her brother did not.  And Grigsby put
two-and-two together, and realised that Ezra, the leader of Malice, is
a wolf.  We got to see Dodge's hidden drug lab, which has been
enlisted by Zagan to make something strong enough to knock out a
robot, so you can investigate Ezra.  And finally you all went to
Mistfield Farm to investigate a note Sister Mary slipped in the last
food shipment, saying "this place is a lie".  Oi found Sister Mary,
tied up in a shed, but was captured herself while freeing the Sister.
We ended the session with Oi just having escaped her bonds, but her
raincoat has been taken away.

*Continuing at Mistfield Farm...*

Leah slips away from the tour, and finds Oi and Sister Mary.  Luckily,
Leah has some spare waterproofs with her.

*Back with the tour...*

Zagan and Brother Grome are talking about the farming
techniques---though really it's more Zagan just directing a constant
stream of questions---when grek, BGrother Grome's assistant shows up.
Grek says that "some wild dogs" got into one of the storehouses, but
they've been dealt with.  Brother Grome says he'll have a look at the
damage later.

Grigsby is keeping a close eye on the farmers, looking for anything
suspicious.  He's walking around, trying different viewpoints,
focussing on different things; and it pays off.  As one man raises his
hand to wipe the sweat from his brow, his sleeve slips back, revealing
a slave tattoo on his wrist.  Grigsby then spots it on a few other
people.  Everyone here is a slave!

Overcome with a righteous zeal, Grigsby leaps atop a soap box, and
proclaims that everyone is free!  They are slaves no longer!

Everyone turns to look at him.  Brother Grome begins to splutter.
"These people are here to seek salvation," he says, "it is right that
they work."

Zagan takes out a gun, holds it to Brother Grome's head, and says
Apotheosis doesn't deal with slavers.

Brother Grome loses all his cool.  "These people are filthy sinners!
This is the only way to seek redemption!"  His face shows a mixture of
rage and confusion, how could you all not see?

Leah then shows up with Sister Mary and Oi.  Sister Mary all beaten
and bloody, and Oi clutching some waterproofs which are clearly not
the ones she arrived in.

Sister Mary is nervous but, with Leah's encouragement, manages to
confront Brother Grome.  "This is no salvation," she spits.

Zagan decides he's had enough, and shoots Brother Grome in the head.

Feeling very proud of himself, Grigsby is suddenly brought back to
reality when many of the farmers start gathering their things as if to
head off---"we need this food!" Zagan says---so Grigsby hops back on
his soapbox and just about manages to persuade some to stay, but most
do not.

*In the Apotheosis hangar...*

Leah and Dodge are ready to take the plane out.  Leah gets in cockpit
to taxi it out, and Dodge slides open the hangar door.

Zagan is waiting for them, with some of his men.  He says that this
plane belongs to him.  Sure, Leah put it together, but where did she
get most of the pieces from?  Apotheosis supplies.

Leah doesn't back down.  She starts to taxi the plane out onto the
runway.  Dodge clambers aboard taking the rear seat as it passes.
Zagan and his men jump aside, rather than be run down.  Leah is
serious about taking this plane out.

And... up it goes!  Towards the clouds, into them, and then through;
into a sky so bright and blue.  Leah pops open the hatch, and she and
Dodge swap seats above the clouds.  Dodge gives the controls a few
wiggles, and immediately starts doing barrel rolls and loops.

"Guess we need to give it a name" "Archimedes"

Eventually though, it's time to return to base.  Down, down through
the clouds, into a world which seems so grey now.

Zagan is waiting.

"Do you know how much airplane fuel costs?  I'll give you a hint: they
don't make it."

he makes it clear that there will be no more flights without his
say-so.

*A few evenings later...*

The Malice delegation shows up for the planned celebration.  Ezra,
some of his troops, and a large number of traders.  Zagan welcomes
them with open arms, though he and Ezra both know that the party is
just for the people... the real point of this meeting is business
dealings.

Oi is apprehensive, and keeps an eye on Ezra from a distance.

Ezra and Zagan are closeted in his office alone most of the time, and
Zagan manages to slip him the poison---knocking Ezra out---without
anyone from Malice being any the wiser.  Zagan carries him to Leah at
the radio shack, but Grigsby turns him away: he doesn't want Ezra near
Innkeeper.  Zagan and Leah move to the hangar, and put Ezra down on a
workbench for Leah to have a look.

Leah sets up her equipment, eases herself into a trance, and focusses
her attention on Ezra.  As soon as she does, it all goes wrong.

Ezra snaps back to consciousness, examining Leah through the
maelstrom.  She feels like an insect underneath a magnifying glass,
Ezra's mind piercing all of her defences.  He sits up, Leah falls back
to the floor.  Zagan tries to grab Ezra, but he effortlessly resists,
and with one hand pins Zagan in a vice-like grip.  With the other hand
he takes Zagan's gun.

Leah shakily gets out her gun, and tries to threaten Ezra.  He just
says that he'd rather not start shooting now, the noise would draw
people and he doesn't want to have to kill everyone here himself, he'd
much rather the people of Apotheosis destroy themselves.

Leah asks why he's doing this.  "This game has lasted too long, we've
grown bored of it."

Oi now drops on Ezra's head from the ceiling.  He drops his gun, still
holding onto Zagan, to reach up and fling her off.  Leah takes the
opportunity to shoot.

Ezra staggers back, losing his grip on Zagan, though he doesn't look
too hurt.  Freed of Oi, he starts to recover, but Zagan managed to use
the moment of distraction to grab a car battery charger, and now clips
it to Ezra's armpits.  He screams, the electricity courses through his
body, burning his flesh, which starts smoking and peeling, revealing
the hot metal beneath.

Quiet.

Roark bursts in, with some of his men, and tries to take stock of the
situation.  he asks what's going on.  Zagan doesn't explain, he just
says to go watch the party, things are probably going to get messy
soon.

Leah cautiously examines Ezra, confirming that he's dead---or whatever
happens to robots---and enters her trance again.  She learns:

- Ezra was made in the same clinic as Innkeeper, but before the
  apocalypse.  The men operating on him bore the same symbol, and were
  talking about "the war" and about "ending it soon".

- Ezra is working for some other person, and communicates with them
  through the maelstrom.  A few weeks ago, in his office in Malice,
  Ezra gave a report of the subjugation of the local area to this
  person: "Malice has fallen", "the infiltration of Apotheosis is
  going well", "this is one of the last remaining large settlements in
  this area, the rest have fallen".

- Ezra isn't malicious, he felt no enjoyment at reporting the woes of
  the surrounding area, just the satisfaction of someone who knows
  they have done a job which needs to be done.  Whoever he was
  speaking to, however, felt immense boredom.

Worried that this may have immediate consequences, Oi reaches out into
the maelstrom to sense for any wolves.  There are none nearby, Ezra
came alone.  She does realise, however, that one of Ezra's troops---a
mean-looking, big, tall, bald brute with a shotgun strapped to his
side---would be trouble.  She hops into the airplane, guns pointed at
the hangar door, to hide.

*Outside...*

Ruby was enjoying herself at the party, but now the atmosphere is
tense.  There have been gunshots, a scream, and people are starting to
realise it's been a while sinze Ezra or Zagan were last seen.  It's no
longer a matter of if this kicks off, it's a matter of when.

She looks around and spots two Malice troops---weapons in
hand---alone, at the edge of the party peering towards the source of
the noise earlier; and she promptly shoots them both with her pistol
(a big thing called "Onyx Rose").

There's a moment of stunned silence.

Then Malice troops move to surround her, people start screaming and
running, and Apotheosis troops start to fight their way through the
crowd.

Ruby stares down the biggest and meanest looking guy: tall, bald, with
a shotgun strapped to his side.  He meets her gaze and challenges her
to single combat.

The fight is short, it's just like that when everyone has guns and
little cover.

It ends with Ruby diving for cover as she shoots the guy: him taking
two bullets to the throat, and her taking a shotgun blast to the
chest.  He collapses to the floor, blood and spit foaming out his
mouth.  Apotheosis troops show up, quickly subdue the other Malice
troops, and Roark stabilises Ruby's condition.

*Later...*

Grigsby sat thinking about Malice.  It used to be a bunch of
disconnected gangs, but Ezra unified them, and seemingly did a good
job at it.  But now he's gone, so things will be changing again.

Would they, perhaps, accept Innkeeper as their leader?  He opeend his
mind to the maelstrom, turning his focus towards Malice and
felt... corruption.  Ezra unified them all right, but at what cost?
Grigsby intuitively knew that they would accept Innkeeper as their
leader, but only because she was somewhat similar to Ezra.  Even with
a perfect leader, it is only a matter of time before the seeds Ezra
has sown will drive the people of Malice to destruction.

Grigsby's thoughts turned to his companions.  How did he feel about
the return of Innkeeper?  And how did he feel about Zagan, the man who
had tried to kill her?  He had suppressed all memory of Innkeeper out
of trauma, but those mental walls have been torn down.

Forgetting Innkeeper suppressed some of his personality, it made him
meeker.  Now that she's back he's remembering what it means to fight
for someone again.  The scene at Mistfield would never have played out
with the old Grigsby.

Zagan is a problem.  He is capable of great evil, but Grigsby just
can't treat him as a lost cause.  He's trying to guide Zagan to do
moral things, rather than just being the passive and obedient servant
he has been so far; though Grigsby doesn't want to challenge Zagan
directly.


Session 6, 2020-05-23
---------------------

Last session you liberated Mistfield Farm from the control of Brother
Grome, after discovering that he was keeping people there as slaves.
To his dying breath, he insisted that this was necessary for their
salvation.  Most of the farmers packed their bags and left, but a few
stayed behind.  Also, Leah and Dodge took out the plane, and got to
see the blue sky above the clouds.  And finally, you managed to take
out Ezra, learning that he was made before the apocalypse, and by the
same group that worked on Innkeeper.  It seems some group has been
working for a long time towards the downfall of civilisation.  With
Ezra gone, it's not clear what will happen to Malice in the near
future, but their eventual downfall due to his corruption seems
certain.

- Leah and Grigsby in the radio shack workshop working on the
  isolation chamber:
  - Huge metal cage, one seat in the middle with wrist and leg straps,
    hooked up to big signal generator (size of a fridge, lots of
    smaller generators fused together, exposed circuitry)
  - Grigsby being uncharacteristically quiet, just sitting down and
    watching
  - Straps Innkeeper in
  - Leah hears a quiet and distant sound, but she recognises it
    immediately: the hangar door opening
  - Grigsby didn't hear it
  - Leah runs out to the hangar, Grigsby following protesting, see
    Bones taking the plane out
  - Leah doesn't want to damage the plane, so she just watches it take off
  - Sends Grigsby to find Dodge so they can pursue

- Oi is afraid of a device which can cut people off from the
  maelstrom, so she takes a component from the big signal generator
  and hides it in her den

*Meanwhile...*

- Ruby going to the clinic, Zagan paid for her treatment:
  - Run by Shan, a big scarred guy.  He has a dog, an alsatian.
  - It's a tiny room, one bed, medical equipment, he just stops people
    from dying and then sends them on their way to heal the rest
    themselves.
  - Shan shoes the dog out, tells her to get on the bed and he'll have
    a look.
  - Peels off the bloody clothes, has a look
  - Offers her some whiskey "this will sting"
  - Cleans the wounds with a grey-looking cloth, picks out the
    bullets, stitches together the larger holes
  - Takes a step back to admire his handywork, cleaning his hands on
    a cloth that looks rather like the one he used to clean her wounds
  - "Let the dog back in on your way out"

*Meanwhile...*

- Dodge with Innkeeper talking about her idea:
  - To run a bookies out of the bar: Dinnerlady takes the bets, Dodge
    wins the races.  People currently gamble, but a less-below-board
    person handling the money will make people feel safer and so get
    involved more.
  - It's an idea she's talked about before, but this is the first time
    she's had a serious discussion with him about making it a reality.
  - The bar is quiet at this time of day, they're in a booth talking.
  - Dinnerlady is skeptical, it sounds like he's getting all the work
    and risk—Dodge would be racing anyway—and only half the money.
  - He asks for 80%.  Dodge says no. Escalates into an argument.
  - Dinnerlady throws Dodge out, bans her from the bar, steals her
    idea.

*Then...*

- Ruby goes to the bar:
  - Innkeeper looks mad, Ruby asks why, he explains the situation
  - Offers her a job for this gambling thing: 10%, she just has to be
    there (which she would be anyway) and stop any trouble that starts
  - "Drinks included?"  "Two"
  - Ok.

*Meanwhile...*

- Dodge collides with Grigsby
  - Grigsby explains the situation "something about a stolen plane",
    points at it in the distance
  - Get car, get Leah, keep Grigsby, go in pursuit
  - Catch up after a few hours: plane is going slowly, meandering,
    eventually lands
  - Bones gets out, totally unconcerned, holding papers, "oh, I didn't
    expect to see anyone"
  - Leah slaps him, asks what he's doing, he drops the papers in the
    wet mud, "what did you do that for?" starts gathering them and
    brushing the mud off.
  - "It's really hard to make notes while flying one of those, now
    that you're here, would you mind helping me organise these notes?"
  - He had to come out to verify some parts of the map for himself,
    Grigsby is sad that his information wasn't good enough, Bones
    tries to reassure him by saying it was very good, but not quite up
    to the standards of cartography
  - "You're never using this plane again!" "I know, it's out of fuel,
    that's why I landed."
  - "How did you plan to get back?" there's camping supplies for a few
    days in the back seat; he'd have been killed by wild animals or
    raiders, but he didn't think of that
  - "What would you do if Zagan gets mad with you?" "Oh, well, he
    doesn't know where the lab is, so I'd just hide out for a few
    days"
  - Decide to tow plane back, Leah attaches plane to car
  - Grigsby gives Leah a chocolate bar, Leah gives Grigsby her pistol
    (temporarily)
  - Drive starts, slowly
  - Grigsby concentrating on the gun, opens his mind, sees Archimedes
    (Leah's grandfather) with a young Leah on his knee, explaining how
    you can use the echo of a gunshot to judge a distance, he's kindly
    and loving, and sad that his granddaughter will grow up in a world
    where having those traits means people will most likely take
    advantage of you.
  - Sun setting, raiders arrive.  Three on motorbikes, two with guns
    out.
  - Leah trying to get a look, one of the raiders spots her and heads
    towards the plane, rest continue to the car.
  - Each shoot at the other, miss
  - Overtaking, get level, each shoot; 1-harm Leah 2-harm raider
    thrown off his bike
  - Other two see, go to their fallen boss
  - Drive on to Apotheosis.

*Meanwhile...*

- Zagan at the factory, looking for signs of Malice infiltration
  - Zagan asks Mouse, the foreman, if anything is unusual
  - "Strange how?"
  - There have been more fights lately.  They stop the fights pretty
    quickly, so people don't usually start them, but lately people
    have seemed to get more violent more quickly
  - Doing the rounds, Zagan sees a guy all over the place, talking to
    people a lot, looks suspicious
  - Zagan drags him out, ignoring his protests, to the acid river
  - Asks how many of them there are
  - "The factory has lots of errand boys!"
  - Zagan dunks him in the acid water and holds him under until his
    face starts to melt
  - His eyelids and lips gone, eyes almost melted, screams in pain as
    he tries to look at Zagan
  - "Tell me and I'll shoot you.  If you don't I'll put you back in,
    and it takes longer to die than you'd expect."
  - There are four of them: Corbet, Kettle, and Isle, told to come in
    and make trouble
  - Zagan pushes him into the water
  - Gathers the rest
  - Pushes them in too

- A tearful Oi approaches Zagan as he finishes:
  - Says she thinks Leah and Grigsby are dead—she didn't mean to kill
    them—she took something from their machine and they haven't been
    around for hours
  - Zagan reassures her, they look around, see Dodge is gone and so's
    the car, Zagan says they probably needed to go out for something
  - Oi opens her brain, sees them south and approaching again


The End
-------

I decided to cut the campaign short because I started running a game
of Call of Cthulhu with a separate group, and realised just how much
less fun I was finding Apocalypse World.
