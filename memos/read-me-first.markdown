Welcome to my collection of memos!

It's not exactly like a normal blog, so before complaining "wow, this
article is weirdly specific and not applicable at all," bear in mind:

1. Many memos are written with *me* as the target audience!
2. The narrower the target audience, the less polished the memo is
   likely to be.
3. Sometimes I'll go back and update a memo.

Each memo has a **Target Audience** which you should check before
reading.  Some have an **Epistemic Status**, which summarises how
objectively true the content is.  Some have an **Attention
Conservation Notice**, to give a very brief summary of what you can
expect.

You are probably now wondering *why not just have a normal blog?*
Well, I did.  I've had several.  My problem with blogging is that I
feel like every post needs to be interesting, polished, and generally
to a high standard.  *I* like reading such blogs, so surely *my* blog
should be the same, right?  The problem is that this creates a lot of
pressure, and leads to me barely ever updating the damn thing.

But this website is a collection of articles I have written and
published, right?  Isn't that just a blog?  Well maybe I am just
deceiving myself by calling these articles "memos" rather than "blog
posts," but I am now writing more, and writing for myself in addition
to writing for others.

So overall it is a good deception.
