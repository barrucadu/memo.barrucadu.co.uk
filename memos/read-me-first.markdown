Welcome to my collection of memos!

It's not exactly like a normal blog, so before complaining "wow, this
article is weirdly specific and not applicable at all," check the
**Target Audience** field:

1. *General* memos are written for everyone
2. *Narrow* memos are generally me working something out or
   documenting something for myself, but which others may find
   interesting
3. *Personal* memos are written for me

Some memos have an **Attention Conservation Notice**, to give a very
brief summary of what you can expect.

You are probably now wondering *why not just have a normal blog?*
Well, I did.  I've had several.  My problem with blogging is that I
feel like every post needs to be interesting, polished, and generally
to a high standard.  *I* like reading such blogs, so surely *my* blog
should be the same, right?  The problem is that this creates a lot of
pressure, and leads to me barely ever updating the damn thing.

But this website is a collection of articles I have written and
published, right?  Isn't that just a blog?  Well maybe I am just
deceiving myself by calling these articles "memos" rather than "blog
posts," but I am now writing more, and writing for myself in addition
to writing for others.

So overall it is a good deception.
