This is a collection of campaigns I think I would enjoy running, and
systems I would like to run them in.  This is not an exhaustive list.


The Guild of Adventurers
------------------------

Maybe you're not suited to take over the family business, got into
trouble and had to leave respectable society, or just feel the call of
the wild: in any case, you've ended up a low-ranking member of the
Guild of Adventurers.

You and the rest of the party are all fairly new, and have become
friends.  The guild higher ups have noticed, and have put you together
into a team.  The Guild will supply quests suited to your experience
and outfit you with basic equipment.

**System:** Mythras

**Setting:** sword & sorcery with medium magic: most cities will have
wizards offering magical services for money; magic organisations
exist; but magic is rare outside the privileged few.

Organisations (religions, magical orders, academies, guilds, etc) are
a significant part of every-day life, with almost everyone in at least
one organisation.  I think that will give a lot of scope for politics,
which will be fun.

We can flesh out the history before the campaign starts by playing a
game of Microscope.

**Player Buy-in:** you're a gang of newbie adventurers happy with
fetch quests and dungeon crawls.  You're not chosen heroes, and the
more experienced adventurers will probably look down on you.  The
Guild will supply plot hooks, should you wish to take them, but I
expect the game to become more self-directed over time.  There will be
opportunity to get mixed up with politics---both internal and
external---if you want that.


Worldbuilding Deep Dive
-----------------------

We start by building a world with Microscope, and then play through
interesting points of history with whatever system seems appropriate
(eg, if we pick a fantasy setting, maybe Mythras).

We might play one period and one set of characters for months, or we
might rapidly jump from one end of the timeline to the other, or
something else entirely.

Occasionally we will play further sessions of Microscope (or the Union
and Chronicle rulesets) to flesh out the world more.

**System:** Microscope (for worldbuilding) & something else (for
actual play)

**Setting:** flexible

**Player Buy-in:** you have to be happy with a lot of worldbuilding
and also with switching up characters a lot.  We should also decide on
a case-by-case basis whether players can change established history,
and how to handle any contradictions.
