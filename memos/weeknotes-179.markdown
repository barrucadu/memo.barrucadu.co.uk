## Books

This week I read:

- [Designing Data-Intensive Applications][] by Martin Kleppmann

  This was really good.  It covered a lot of different topics,
  explained them really well, and gradually built up the complexity
  over the book, with each chapter building on the previous.  I knew
  much of the content at a high level already, and this helped me
  drill into some known (and unknown) unknowns.  I like that each
  chapter has copious references too: I'll definitely be following up
  on those for additional reading material.

- Volumes 2 and 3 of [So I'm a Spider, So What?][] by Okina Baba

  Volume 1 was fun, these were also fun.  Volume 3 ends at the same
  point as episode 12 of the 24-episode anime series, so the rest of
  the anime probably covers volumes 4, 5, and 6.  There are 16 volumes
  so far (with 13 translated), so there's still a lot of story to go.

  Translated stuff feels like it goes out of print fairly quickly
  though, so I'll buy the other volumes very soon, rather than
  gradually over the a few years like I tend to do with English series
  I'm following.  That approach bit me with the [20th Century Boys][]
  manga: the editions I *was* buying are now out of print, and the
  current editions divide up the content differently, making mixing
  them with the volumes I do have a bit awkward.

- Volume 1 of [That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime][] by Fuse

  Unfortunately, this was not so fun.  It's a shame, because I have
  quite enjoyed the anime for this, but this volume was not very good.
  It was very fast-paced, moving from event to event to event, without
  really leaving any time for character development between these.  At
  times, I found myself wondering "Ok, but why do these characters now
  trust each other?  They've only just met!"  The anime has definitely
  taken some liberties to re-arrange and expand existing scenes, and
  to add new ones.

  I compared it with a random volume of [Overlord][] (looking forward
  to volume 14 of that coming out in a few months), and the difference
  in writing quality was like night and day.

  Well, I've got volumes 2 and 3 on the way.  I'll read those as well
  to give the series a fair shot---it's not much of an investment, one
  light novel volume only takes a few hours to get through---but
  unless the writing improves I don't think I'll continue reading this
  one.

I did some pruning of my nonfiction, deciding to donate, recycle, or
otherwise get rid of, a few books which I've had for years, never
read, and never will read.  I don't habitually get rid of books (see
my perpetual need for more shelf space), but if I'm not going to read
something even *once*, and not even use it for reference material,
there's not much point in keeping it.

## Miscellaneous

A whole week off.  It passed quickly and slowly at the same time.
What did I do with it?  I don't really know.

I read some books.

I slept in a lot.

I upgraded [bookdb][] and [bookmarks][] to Elasticsearch 8 (which was
pretty easy: I upgraded [the servers to 7.17][], then [the client
libraries to 8.0][], then [the servers to 8.0 and changed a config
option][] which had a different default value in 8.0; no complex
migration or anything needed).

A friend started a new Minecraft server which I've been poking around
on.

And that's about all I can remember.

Time has definitely become more fuzzy, but that's ok.  A rigid
schedule is overrated: eat when you're hungry, sleep when you're
tired, read or play when the mood strikes, and so on.
