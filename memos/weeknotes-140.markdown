## Work

This week didn't feel very productive.  I finished my time on support
on Tuesday, and returned to team work on Wednesday.  Then I picked up
one ticket and got it into review.


## Books

This week I read:

- [The Monsters Know What They're Doing][] by Keith Ammann.

  I found this really helpful, it first gives [some rules for how to
  predict monster behaviour][] and then the rest of the book is worked
  examples.  I used some lessons from this for my Call of Cthulhu
  session prep, to help with when the players encountered an invisible
  tentacle beast which is invulnerable to normal weapons but harmed by
  bright light.  I've got tactics for a few more monsters planned out
  too, which hopefully will get some use in the near future.

  This book would be *more* useful if I were running D&D, as the
  worked examples are all D&D-specific.  But even though I'm not,
  they're good for inspiration.

## Freenode Drama

[Freenode][] has been having some drama recently.  [Libera.Chat][] is
now the place to be.

Some years ago, the former head of Freenode staff sold a holding
company which managed Freenode's assets to a third party.  The staff
weren't told the details of the sale, but were assured that nothing
would change and that the new owner would not be assuming operational
control.

That changed recently, with the owner Andrew Lee (who goes by the nick
rasengan) asserting control over the network, taking ownership of the
domain name, infrastructure, and data.

A lot of the current Freenode staff have resigned: [amdj](https://gist.github.com/aaronmdjones/1a9a93ded5b7d162c3f58bdd66b8f491), [edk](https://gist.github.com/edk0/478fb4351bc3ba458288d6878032669d), [emilsp](https://gist.github.com/pinkisemils/39d4ded8b1639b6f39dcab15618649f5), [Fuchs](https://fuchsnet.ch/freenode-resign-letter.txt), [Jess](https://gist.github.com/jesopo/45a3e9cdbe517dc55e6058eb43b00ed9), [JonathanD](https://gist.github.com/JonathanD82/6518b93708e0aaf4b8f92c8e7200816d), [kline](https://kline.sh/), [Md](https://blog.bofh.it/debian/id_461), [mniip](https://mniip.com/freenode.txt), [niko](https://coevoet.fr/freenode.html), [njan](http://jeremiad.org/freenode.shtml), [Swant](https://swantzter.se/freenode-resignation/).

rasengan wrote [a reasonable-seeming response on the Freenode blog][],
and I admit I was hopeful that there had maybe just been some huge
misunderstanding and that the whole thing was massively overblown.

Unfortunately, that hope was dashed, when it turns out that [rasengan
deregistered a channel which had moved to Libera.Chat][].  If you're
not an IRC user you might not see what the big deal is: someone moved
their channel to another network, and so a network operator
deregistered the channel on the old network, so what?  Well,
historically there is a *very* strong taboo against network operators
interfering with how channel operators run things (and, indeed, in
doing anything really beyond keeping the network running smoothly).
So deregistering a channel which isn't a clear and present threat to
the network is already a big no-no; but even more than that, it's
against [Freenode's own published policies][] which currently state
that a topic channel expires after 60 days.

So, the owner of Freenode is not only breaking a big cultural taboo,
he's also breaking official policy.  And who can reprimand the owner
of the network for this violation?  Nobody, he's at the top.

I'm still connected to Freenode, for now, but I've moved over to
Libera.Chat for normal IRC usage.
