title: Metaphysics for Hermetic Magic

This is an attempt to find a consistent metaphysical underpinning for
Hermetic magic theory in Ars Magica 5.  The aim is to come up with a
system which:

- Roughly fits in with medieval philosophy.
- Makes sense in a setting where God the creator exists as fact.
- Justifies the different scopes of the different Hermetic arts.
- Is specific enough to be falsifiable.

The result is more or less a theory of Ideas[^forms], with bits added
on to make the magic work.

[^forms]: More popularly known as "Forms".  For example, all round
  things are related to the Idea of "roundness", which exists
  independently of any individual round thing, and indeed cannot be
  perfectly represented in the physical world, as all real things have
  imperfections.  To avoid confusion I'll use "Idea" to refer to the
  Platonic concept, and "form" to refer to the Hermetic forms.

The Arts and Academe sourcebook talks about the Aristotelian theory of
Ideas, which I don't think is inconsistent with the system put forward
here, as it's mostly a way of categorising properties.  Also, that
book doesn't explain how Muto and Rego fit in with the theory.


The Hermetic arts
------------------

Hermetic magic is based on several different *techniques* and *forms*,
collectively known as *arts*.  This forms a verb/noun system: the
technique is the sort of effect you want to apply, and the form is the
sort of thing you want to apply the effect to.

In this memo we're most concerned with the techniques, which are:

- **Creo:** creation, improvement, healing, and maturation:
    - "Creo magic makes things that exist independently into better
      things of their kind, which includes bringing them into
      existence from nothing."
    - "Creo can both create and heal things."
    - "Creo can make a horse as swift as the fastest horse."
    - "Creo cannot make a horse able to run as fast as the wind,
      because no ordinary horse can do that."
    - "Since maturation involves becoming a better example of your
      kind, Creo magic can make something mature quickly."
- **Intellego:** unhindered perception:
  - "It allows a maga to gather information directly from the forms of
    things."
  - "This information does not deal with the appearances of things,
    unless Intellego Imaginem magic is used."
  - "Intellego magic is not deceived by mundane disguises."
- **Muto:** unnatural transformation:
  - "A magus can grant or remove properties something cannot naturally
    have."
  - "Muto magic cannot affect the properties that something has
    naturally, although it can add other properties to them to mask
    their effects."
- **Perdo:** destruction and degradation:
  - "Perdo makes things worse examples of the kind of thing they are.
    It is the opposite of Creo."
  - "Perdo magic can simply destroy things, removing them completely
    from existence, or it can destroy aspects of a thing."
  - "Perdo Corpus could remove a person's weight."
  - "Perdo Ignem could make a fire unable to burn anything."
  - "Perdo alone can only destroy the whole of a natural property."
  - "Perdo can only make something a worse example of what it is.  You
    cannot sharpen a sword with Perdo, even though sharpening involves
    removing some of the metal."
- **Rego:** natural transformation:
  - "Rego allows a maga to change the state of a thing to some other
    state that the individual can naturally have."
  - "Rego magic allows a maga to move things around."
  - "Rego can also make a tree blossom out of season, put a person to
    sleep, shape a piece of stone into a statue, or weave thread into
    a tunic."
  - "It cannot make an animal appear young, because mature animals
    cannot naturally become young."
  - "Rego also cannot make an animal old, because aging is decay away
    from the form."
  - "Rego cannot turn a brown dog black, because while dogs can
    naturally be black, the brown dog in question cannot naturally
    take on that colour."
  - "Any change that a mundane craftsman can make can also be made by
    Rego magic."

The forms are:

- **Animal:** animals of all kind, cannot affect people.
- **Aquam:** water and other liquids, as well as properties of
  liquidity.
- **Auram:** air, wind, weather, and gaseous forms in general.
- **Corpus:** human bodies and bodies of human-shaped magical and
  faerie creatures, living or dead.
- **Herbam:** plant matter of all kind, living or dead.
- **Ignem:** fire, heat, and light.
- **Imaginem:** the processes by which things emit species[^species].
- **Mentem:** minds, thoughts, and spirits.
- **Terram:** solids.
- **Vim:** raw magical power.

[^species]: SPEH-kee-ayss.  The fundamental particles of sensory data.
  All things emit species of different sorts constantly.

Ideas and Natures
-----------------

To summarise the techniques:

- Creo makes things into a *better example of their kind*: it can make
  a horse as fast as the fastest horse, but not faster than any horse
  could be.
- Intellego tells you about the *true nature* of a thing, and isn't
  affected by mundane disguises.
- Muto adds or removes properties that a thing *could not naturally
  have*: it can give a horse wings.
- Perdo makes things into a *worse example of their kind*: it can
  damage or destroy things.  Perdo can also remove *natural
  properties*[^perdo].
- Rego makes changes which could naturally occur: it can move things,
  put them to sleep, and so on.

[^perdo]: Perdo is a bit of an outlier, because it seems it can do two
  qualitatively different things.  Is there a Hermetic breakthrough
  awaiting discovery which splits Perdo into two arts which can be
  mastered individually?

This seems to be referencing a concept of Ideas: individuals belong to
some sort of ontological groups and have "natural" properties and
"unnatural" properties.

<aside class="highlight">
**Idea:** the very core of a thing's being.  All horses have the Idea
"horse".  All dogs have the Idea "dog".  All men have the Idea "man".
If an Idea property could be permanently removed from an object, it
would become a fundamentally different sort of thing.
</aside>

Elsewhere the core book talks about the *Essential Nature* of a thing.
For example, a person could have "blindness" in their Essential
Nature: such a person would have been born blind, and cannot have
their sight restored by Creo, even though that fits under the umbrella
of making things into a better example of their kind.

This suggests that either Ideas are more specific than "man" or
"dog"---are more like "blind man" (and presumably "brown dog")---or
that Ideas only explain part of the story, and things have a secondary
set of natural properties.  I adopted the second approach (see the
alternative theories section for why), and call this secondary set of
natural properties the *Individual Nature*.

<aside class="highlight">
**Individual Nature:** a collection of additional properties, distinct
from the Idea, and not conflicting with it.  A brown dog has
"brownness" in its Individual Nature, "brownness" is not part of the
Idea of dog because there are dogs of many colours.  A man born blind,
not merely made blind through injury, would have "blindness" in his
Individual Nature.
</aside>

Now we can define Essential Nature:

<aside class="highlight">
**Essential Nature:** all the properties which a thing naturally has.
The combination of the Idea and the Individual Nature.
</aside>

Here is our first attempt at explaining the techniques:

- Creo improves an object's expression of its Essential Nature.
- Intellego informs you about the Essential Nature of an object.
- Muto adds new properties to an object, or removes other Muto-added
  properties.
- Perdo degrades an object's expression of its Essential Nature, or
  removes properties from the Essential Nature.
- Rego changes an object in a way which doesn't affect its Essential
  Nature.

This sort of works, but not fully.  Where do the properties added by
Muto go?  To the Idea?  To the Nature?  How come Muto can only remove
properties which were added with Muto?  Why cannot Perdo remove such
properties?  How does an object "remember" properties removed with
Muto or Perdo (so they can come back when the magic ends)?  Is
Intellego fooled by Muto or Perdo?  The broad strokes of the theory
seem right, but there are gaps.

Let's add a new bag of properties for Muto:

<aside class="highlight">
**Quasi-nature:** an ordered collection of yet more properties,
distinct from the Essential Nature.  A horse which has been given
wings with magic would have "wingedness" in its Quasi-nature.  If two
conflicting properties are added, the later one overrides the earlier
one.  No thing naturally has a Quasi-nature.
</aside>

To solve the problem of remembering removed properties so that they
can come back, there are three options:

1. Properties could move from the Idea into a "Shadow Idea" and from
  the Nature into a "Shadow Nature" and from the Quasi-nature into a
  "Shadow Quasi-nature".
2. We can introduce state: properties can be enabled or disabled.
3. We can introduce a concept of anti-properties, which nullify an
   existing property.

I went for option (3).  Option (1) adds three new bags of properties,
which feels like a lot.  Option (2) opens the possibility of things
having disabled-by-default properties, which doesn't feel right, and
why would properties have a state anyway?  Option (3) feels pretty
contrived, but less so than (1) and doesn't have the problem of (2).

To remove a Muto-added property from the Quasi-nature, Muto can add an
overriding anti-property to the Quasi-nature.  But what about Perdo?
Perdo can only remove properties a thing could naturally have, so
Perdo's anti-properties cannot be put into the Quasi-nature.  Consider
this sequence of events:

1. A stone weighing 10kg is found.
2. One magus casts Muto on the stone, changing its weight to 20kg.
3. Another magus casts Perdo on the stone, nullifying its weight.

Is the weight of the stone 20kg, 10kg, or 0kg?  As Perdo can only
remove *natural* properties, surely it cannot affect the *unnatural*
weight produced by Muto.  Therefore the stone must weigh 20kg.
However, if Perdo added an "anti-weight" anti-property to the
Quasi-nature, then the 20kg would be nullified, as Perdo was cast
after Muto, making the stone weigh 10kg!  The only way the stone could
weigh 0kg is if Perdo overrode Muto, and an anti-property overrode
*all* matching properties.

So we also need a bag of anti-properties for Perdo:

<aside class="highlight">
**Anti-nature:** a collection of anti-properties, which nullify
properties in the Essential Nature.  A horse which has had its weight
nullified has "anti-weight" in its Anti-nature.  No thing naturally
has an Anti-nature.
</aside>

Perdo cannot override Perdo (there are no anti-anti-properties), so
unlike with Muto there is no need to track the order in which spells
are cast, and so an unordered collection is fine.

Both Perdo and Muto can override the Essential Nature, but Perdo
cannot override Muto.  So we have an unambigious way to combine the
bags of properties, giving the *Nature* of a thing:

<aside class="highlight">
**Nature:** the combination of the Essential Nature, Anti-nature, and
Quasi-nature.  Take all the properties in the Essential Nature, remove
those for which there are anti-properties in the Anti-nature, and then
apply the properties and anti-properties in the Quasi-nature in order.
</aside>

Now we can explain the techniques:

- Creo improves an object's expression of its Nature.
- Intellego informs you about the Nature of an object.
- Muto adds new properties to the Quasi-nature of an object, or adds
  anti-properties to the Quasi-nature of an object if it has the
  matching property already in its Quasi-nature.
- Perdo degrades an object's expression of its Nature, or adds
  anti-properties to the Anti-nature of an object if it has a matching
  property in its Essential Nature.
- Rego changes an object in a way which doesn't affect its Nature.


Alternative theories
--------------------

The obvious alternative to the above theory is to unify Idea with
Individual Nature: each individual has a highly-specific Idea, which
encompasses both what sort of thing it is (eg, "horseness") and also
the unique traits of that individual (eg, "brownness").

The question then becomes: how are these Ideas related?

### Ideas are unrelated

Each individual has its own Idea, and there is no inherent
relationship between the Ideas of different individuals.  Any
relationship which humans use is merely a human theory with no
ontological significance.

This has two main downsides:

1. There is no inherent reason to group individuals together in one
   way over any other way: if any two horse-like beings have totally
   unrelated Ideas, then in what sense are they both horses?  All
   groupings become arbitrary.

   This would suggest that God didn't create "horses", He created many
   similar individuals which humans have since grouped together as
   "horses".  However, there clearly is some ontological significance
   to the group "horses", because horses can breed with other horses,
   and they cannot (for example) with crocodiles.

2. There is no justification for why you could make a spell which
   operates on any arbitrary horse, rather than needing to be
   reinvented for each individual.

### Ideas form a hierarchy

The Ideas of individuals have some inherent grouping, which forms a
hierarchy of Ideas.

There is an Idea of "Bob the horse".  There is an Idea of "Daisy the
horse".  There is also an Idea of "horse", which Bob's and Daisy's
Ideas are sub-Ideas of.

The has three main downsides:

1. It's not clear how many levels the hierarchy should have: are there
   other Ideas between "horse" and "Bob the horse"?  For example, are
   there Ideas for each breed of horse?

2. This splits Ideas into two types: those which correspond to
   individuals, and those which correspond to groups.  In what sense
   are these the same?  And if they're not the same, isn't this just
   the Idea / Individual Nature split in the main theory expressed in
   a more complex way?

3. What direction does the arrow of causality go?  Does the Idea of
   "horse" have properties because all sub-Ideas have those
   properties; or do those sub-Ideas of "horse" have properties
   because the Idea of "horse" does?


What about Hermetic forms?
--------------------------

The theory explains the techniques, but not the forms.  How do they
come into it?

There are a few possibilities:

- There's a "hierarchy of Ideas" thing going on, where the tops of the
  hierarchy are the Hermetic forms.  I don't like this for the same
  reason I don't like the hierarchy of Ideas: the form-Ideas seem
  qualitatively different to other Ideas.  This also feels like it
  implies God came up with the forms before creating any other things,
  and that Hermetic forms reflect the fundamental building blocks of
  reality, which I'm not too satisfied with.

- Form is another category behind Idea, making a thing's Essential
  Nature the combination of the Form, Idea, and Individual Nature.
  But if each aspect of Hermetic magic theory requires a new bag of
  properties in the metaphysical theory, is the theory really
  explaining anything?

- Forms are actually properties[^plato_vs_aristotle], for example the
  form Ignem affects all things with the property "is affected by
  Ignem" in its Idea.  However, if forms are properties, then there
  are no corresponding anti-properties, as you cannot Perdo away a
  thing's ability to be affected by a certain form.  Or maybe you can
  but your Perdo is immediately dispelled, as it can no longer affect
  the object.  This feels pretty ad hoc.

[^plato_vs_aristotle]: This is essentially the difference between
  Platonic realism (Ideas exist independently of any particular
  instance) and Aristotelian realism (Ideas do not exist independently
  of their instances).

I'm leaning towards the third option as it's the least unpleasant,
despite the Perdo behaviour.

Whatever the answer, one thing we can say for certain is that forms
are just a crude approximation to how God built the universe.
