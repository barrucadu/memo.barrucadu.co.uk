## Work

- I fixed an issue with atom feeds for "finders": pages which find
  things, like
  [https://www.gov.uk/search/all](https://www.gov.uk/search/all) and
  [https://www.gov.uk/aaib-reports](https://www.gov.uk/aaib-reports).
  Previously [finder-frontend][], the app which renders finders, would
  only serve an atom feed if the *default* sort order for the finder
  is by recency.  We wanted a feed for `/search/all`, but that
  defaults to sorting by popularity, so no feed.  I made
  finder-frontend [fix the sort order for feeds][], rather than just
  refuse to serve them.

- The rest of the week had a lot of Elasticsearch 6 stuff, and the end
  is finally in sight.  The ES6 cluster is deployed to our production
  and staging environments (previously it was just in integration);
  [search-api is able to talk to both clusters][] (not my work); and
  we've got a plan for A/B testing the switch from Elasticsearch 5.
  There are only two blockers remaining before the A/B test can start:
  we need to import all the data from Elasticsearch 5, and we're going
  to have a chat with some AWS solutions architects to check we have
  the right machine specs for our workload.

## Miscellaneous

- I decided to try my hand at some decorative typesetting, and picked
  the King James Bible.  I've [put it up on GitHub][], and have now
  got the Pentateuch done [with only one really ugly part][].  It's
  been a fun learning experience as I've not tried anything like this
  before.  A long time ago, in preparation for writing [my Ph.D
  thesis][], I read [Butterick's Practical Typography][] to gain some
  basic knowledge, but there's still much to learn.

- I've now been using [DuckDuckGo][] as my main search engine for a
  few weeks now, and it's pretty good.  This came out of an experiment
  at work to figure out what a "good search experience" and a "bad
  search experience" is: turns out Google doesn't have a monopoly on
  good search experiences.
