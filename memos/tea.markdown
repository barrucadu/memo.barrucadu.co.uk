most dire of emergencies.


Teas I don't like
-----------------

- **Assam** and blends which contain it, like **most breakfast teas**.
  Too malty.
- **Lapsang Souchong** it tastes bad cold, and isn't brilliant hot.


I buy tea from
--------------

- [What-Cha][]:
  - Good quality, teas often brew three or four good pots.
  - Free (for orders over Â£25) and prompt (often next-day) delivery.
  - But often missing more standard teas like darjeeling or jasmine, or only carrying expensive variants.

- [Japan Centre][]:
  - Has a lot of "normal" Japanese teas, which more specialist sellers often gloss over.
  - Usually has matcha in stock.
  - But very little fancy stuff.

- [The Tea Makers][]:
  - Has lots of more "normal" teas.
  - But it's of mediocre quality, teas usually only make one or two good pots.
