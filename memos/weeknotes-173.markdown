## Work

This week I got back up to speed after the Christmas break, worked
some more on upgrading our database versions (and we'll be switching
over next week), and reviewed an ADR (architecture decision record) on
email notifications.

Not everyone on the team is back yet, so it was still a slightly slow
week.


## Books

This week I read:

- [The Centauri Device][] by M. John Harrison

  This book was a good example of why I like to read the
  [S. F. Masterworks][] series.  It was a good read, a bit confusing
  in parts (or maybe I was just tired at the time) but certainly
  enjoyable and had some neat ideas (like the space anarchists with
  their captured alien spaceships).  Then I go to check the wikipedia
  article, and find that this book helped revolutionise the Space
  Opera genre by turning the then-typical tropes on their head!

  Now that I know *that* I can think back to other, more modern, books
  that I've read and see the influence.  And now I know where those
  ideas came from.

## Gaming

This week I bought [Dyson Sphere Program][].  I'd been aware of it for
a while, but hadn't felt the urge to try it out and, well, this week I
felt the urge.

I've sunk 30 hours into it over four days.  It's really addictive and
fun.  Making fast and compact assembly lines is like a puzzle, and
when you figure it out it's so satisfying.  Add in the slight
complication of wanting to make neat factories, but building against a
square grid on a sphere (so as you move towards the poles the
gridlines shift), and that adds *just* a tad more challenge.

I'm nowhere near producing a dyson sphere yet.  Bits are going wrong.
I keep running out of oil because I'm not burning hydrogen quickly
enough and the conveyor belts back up and block the refineries.

But it's a lot of fun.

## Miscellaneous

This week I set up fail2ban and an IP blocklist on my VPN.  As usual,
[NixOS made this unexpectedly easy][], and now I have a slightly
better firewall.

IP blocking isn't great because it's easy to circumvent, but there's
one IP which keeps trying to connect to my (whitelisted) Minecraft
server, and seeing them in the logs multiple times a day was just
getting annoying.
