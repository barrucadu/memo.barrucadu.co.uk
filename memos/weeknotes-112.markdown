## Work

The thing has launched!  From [the transition checker][] you can now
opt to store your results in an account, which'll also manage your
email subscription for you (updating the subscription if you save new
answers, deleting the subscription if you delete your account).

It's only a small part of where we want accounts to go, but it's a
useful little thing to put live as we can start to see where the pain
points around signing up and account management are.

The code has been made public too:

- [alphagov/govuk-account-manager-prototype][]
- [alphagov/govuk-attribute-service-prototype][]

## Books

This week I read:

- [Look to Windward][] by Iain M. Banks, the seventh of the [Culture series][].

  War is a recurrent theme in the Culture series.  This one is about a
  commemoration of an event in the Idirian war, and also about how the
  Culture's botched involvement with another species caused them to
  fight a civil war.  Something Iain M. Banks does well is having
  distinct viewpoint characters, but having them sufficiently
  separated that you can't tell when their respective events are
  happening, which worked nicely to give a feeling of tension in parts
  of this book, with a big reveal of the *actual* sequence of events
  at the moment of crisis.

## Games

This week I started to run a Pulp Cthulhu one-shot for my other group,
as we're having a break from our Wolves of God game until January due
to player availability.  I thought we'd get through the full scenario
in one session, but we didn't, so we'll be continuing it in a
fortnight.

It's very helpful to run games for different people, even if they're a
group I've GMed for before, because every group of players engages
with the game in a different way.
