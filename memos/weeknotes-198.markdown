## Work

Since I never have much to write in this section, now that my work is
closed-source, I think I'm going to drop this section as a regular
feature going forwards.  If there's something big to say, I can always
bring it back for a one-off.


## Books

This week I read:

- [MOAR! Monsters Know What They're Doing][] by Keith Ammann

  Like the earlier *Monsters Know What They're Doing*, which I read
  and enjoyed a while back, this covers tactics for D&D monsters
  starting from the assumption that they are "real" creatures which
  live in a world governed by D&D mechanics, so they should have
  evolved or developed an approach to combat which works in such a
  world.

  And like the earlier book, it doesn't claim to be system-neutral.
  This is explicitly a book for people running D&D.

  Unlike the earlier book, I didn't find this one very useful to my
  non-D&D games.  I suppose I can't really fault it for not living up
  to a standard it never claimed, but it was a little disappointing to
  finish the book and realise it was mostly just a waste of time.
  Even worse, it wasn't even very interesting.

  The book covers monster tactics for all the things introduced in
  *Modenkainen's Tome of Foes* and *Volo's Guide to Monsters*.  Even
  though I've never run D&D, the first book was good for getting into
  the mindset and thinking about monster tactics, and also a lot of
  the *Monster Manual* monsters are classic monsters present in lots
  of fantasy games.  So, while the mechanics didn't directly
  translate, a lot of stuff did.  Whereas this book, by virtue of
  covering stuff introduced in supplements which have now come out
  like 4 to 6 years afterwards, has way more D&D-specific things which
  don't show up elsewhere.  Oh well.

  If I were running D&D, however, it would be fantastic.

- [Watchmen][] by Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons

  I've had this sitting on my shelf for a while, probably since around
  the time I read and enjoyed *V for Vendetta* back in 2014, but not
  read it until now.

  Well, I wish I hadn't put if off for so long.  It's great, I really
  enjoyed it.  I'd seen some of the more memorable individual panels
  before (like Dr Manhattan disintegrating Rorschach), but I knew
  almost nothing about the story,[^spoiler] so it was a lot of fun to
  see them actually in context.  While it was consistently good
  throughout, I thought the ending in particular was great.

[^spoiler]: Not that going in blind is needed to enjoy a story, of
  course.  I'm a firm believer that it's about the journey, not the
  destination, and that if a story only works if you fastidiously
  avoid spoilers, deriving all of its quality from surprise, it's
  probably not a very good story.

## Roleplaying Games

### New Arrivals

This week I got the Hot Springs Island books:

![The Dark of Hot Springs Island & A Field Guide to Hot Springs Island.](weeknotes-198/photo-hot-springs-island.jpg)

Luckily, I was in time to get the second edition before it runs out
and they switch to the new (much more generic-looking) third edition
cover.  I've only flipped through it so far, but it looks good.  I
might run this if I start a second fantasy game before my Dolmenwood
game ends: running the same setting in two games concurrently feels
like it could be confusing.

I now own the three big OSR original settings: Wormskin / Dolmenwood,
Yoon-Suin, and Hot Springs Island.


### Dolmenwood

We had the first real session this weekend, the previous session being
character creation and a bit of setting introduction.  We started the
session with the party arriving in the town of Prigwort, a sizeable
settlement in the centre of Dolmenwood, and overhearing a bunch of
rumours as well as getting involved with some NPCs.  A lot happened!

- The party minstrel negotiated an offer of employment, as a
  performer, from one of the inns.  Their secret motive is to use
  their power to ensorcell members of Prigwort's ruling council and
  learn their secrets.

- The party squire learned that the daughter of his liege lord had
  been kidnapped mere days ago by brigands hiding in the nearby ruined
  abbey and talked the rest of the party into taking up the quest to
  save the child.

- The partry friar overheard a hunter telling a tale of being driven
  out of the woods to the north-east by one of the Drune, a sinister
  cabal of mysterious sorcerers, as if the Drune were protecting
  something.  The party made note of it as something to investigate
  later.

- The party hired their first retainer, something I don't think we've
  *ever* done in one of our games before.

- In trying to save the young noble girl, the party were attacked and
  driven off by an undead creature made of beaks and talons called "Mr
  Rag-and-bone", who seems to have charmed the girl and two other
  children, and uses them to dig up graves and collect teeth.  The
  minstrel sustained a nasty scratch and has some sort of black rot
  upon her flesh...

- While hiding from Mr Rag-and-bone, they encountered an undead monk,
  who begged that they end his blasphemous existence, and told them
  that the abbey has been cursed ever since a ritual to invoke the
  spirit of their patron saint went awry one century ago.

It was a pretty fast-paced session, it wasn't action all the time, but
there wasn't much in the way of downtime either.  One character, the
minstrel, almost died (and would have if Mr Rag-and-bone had rolled
higher for his attack)---a character near-death in the first session,
wow!

I'm very much looking forward to the next session, in which the party
plan to go to a herbalist to ask about the minstrel's condition (it's
not good, there will only be two avenues open to them, both of which
will lead to further adventure), and to visit the noblewoman to say
they found her daughter and can they have a force of knights to rescue
her please.  And I'll also seed some more hooks whenever I can, I
definitely want some pointers to more interesting NPCs and locations,
and to start *Winter's Daughter*, which I recently ran for my other
group using the Forbidden Lands system.

I've taken a lot of inspiration from the [3d6 Down the Line Dolmenwood
series on Youtube][], which is a great series for getting into the
setting and the OSE system more generally.

## Miscellaneous

We're on the verge of the new anime season, and there's a lot of stuff
I'm interested in checking out: *Devil is a Part-Timer!* season 2
(that getting announced was a surprise, you don't often see a sequel
10 years after the original), *Overlord* season 4 (I just hope the
animation is better than season 3), *Made in Abyss* season 2, *Shadows
House* season 2, *Luminous Witches*, and more!

It's a very promising line-up, definitely one of the better seasons in
recent memory.
