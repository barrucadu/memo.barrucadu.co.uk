## Work

- The big news is that Elasticsearch 6 is now handling 100% of GOV.UK
  search traffic: we turned the A/B test to 100% B.  I've written a
  post about the whole process for the GOV.UK blog which should be
  coming out in a few weeks time.  Next week we'll tear down
  Elasticsearch 5.  I suggested we spend October's Elasticsearch 5
  budget on snacks, but for some reason didn't hear back about that.

## Miscellaneous

- I finished reading [Metro 2033][] (by Dmitry Glukhovsky).  It was
  good, I didn't see the ending coming.  There are some sequels and
  also a game I might check out.

- I read [The Eye of the World][] (by Robert Jordan), the first book
  in the [Wheel of Time][] series.  I've read it before, but I didn't
  have a date recorded in [bookdb][], which means it was some time
  before 2012.  It's nice generic high fantasy, enjoyable because it's
  very easy to get into and doesn't require much thought.  I never
  actually finished the series, the latest book I have is [Winter's
  Heart][], the 9th of 14.

- I didn't have much luck with flat hunting.  Letting agents seem
  really bad at following instructions like "I won't answer my phone
  during the working day, so either ring me in the evening or email
  me", and I only managed to arrange one booking after contacting 12
  agents.  And that booking fell through because someone paid a
  holding deposit on the day I was due to see it.  I'll just have to
  start ringing agents during my lunch breaks.
