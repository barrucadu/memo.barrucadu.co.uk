## Work

This week felt pretty calm and relaxed, I worked on several tickets,
paired a bunch, and we shipped some things.  In particular, the "get
emails about this page" button is now on a few more pages.  The next
step might be putting it on *all* the pages, or it might not.  We'll
see.

We also had some chats about how a reorganisation is going to affect
the team and what products we own.  It'll only come into effect after
I'm gone, but I can at least help the team to prepare.

Speaking of leaving, I only have one and a half weeks left now.  I had
a call with the manager of what will be my new team at GoCardless the
other day, and learned a bit about what I'll be working on, at least
for the first few quarters.  Lots of scaling and distributed systems
challenges, which sounds like it'll be very interesting.  I'm planning
to brush up on distributed algorithms in my month off, so I can hit
the ground running.


## Books

I have a couple of books on the go, and received some more from Amazon
today, but didn't finish anything this week.  Maybe next week.


## Gaming

### Ars Magica

Next week will, or should be, the final session of my Ars Magica
campaign.

And thank god for that!

Ars Magica is a system I've wanted to play for a long time, and this
short campaign has taught me the error of my ways.  I should have
stuck with simpler systems like Traveller and Call of Cthulhu, or
Dungeons and Dragons.  There are two main difficulties we've had with
the system.  One has been a group-wide issue, the other has just been
a problem for me, the GM:

1. The rules are just really complex.

   Every time a player wants to create a new a spell, we inevitably
   spend half an hour or so just consulting the rules trying to figure
   out how it'll mechanically work.  It really doesn't help that there
   are essentially 50 different types of spell in Ars Magica, and
   *they all behave slightly differently*.  And god help you if the
   player wants to create an enchanted item...

   Everything else is complex too, but there's a formulae reference in
   an appendix.  Which is great, except for all the mechanics where
   you have to roll something and then consult a table, as the tables
   are *not* in that appendix.  So you have to flip back and forth
   through the book a lot anyway.  And some of the rules are buried in
   prose, rather than being clearly delineated.

   I think these issues could be resolved with a new edition of the
   game.  I don't think you'd even need major changes, a 5.5th edition
   focussed on making small changes in aid of consistency and
   reference-ability would help a lot.

2. It's just hard to plan adventures for.

   An Ars Magica game is based around a physical community of wizards.
   Unlike most other systems, the player characters aren't necessarily
   trekking off into the wilderness in search of treasure, they're at
   home doing their own thing, and the game is more
   character-focussed.  I knew that going in, but at least at the
   beginning of the campaign you don't really have all those rich
   interpersonal relationships to generate soap-opera-style drama
   from.

   So I fell back on having adventure come to the players.

   But that just lead to another problem: *why* did adventure keep
   coming to this tiny out-of-the-way Scottish village where the
   player characters happened to live?  It just stretched my
   suspension of disbelief that, month after month, fairies would
   kidnap children, or demons would move into the inn, or mysterious
   children would turn up on the doorstep, and so on.

   I feel like I could have avoided this problem by setting the game
   in an established wizard community, rather than the campaign being
   set in a new one.  At least then there would be all these NPCs with
   their own stuff going on, which would give rise to stories.

I'm glad I tried Ars Magica, and got it out of my system, but I won't
be rushing back.

### Traveller

Unlike Ars Magica, Traveller is going well.  Really well.  The players
have decided to become space pirates.  And so I spent some time making
[a piracy cheatsheet][] (based on the new rules from *Pirates of
Drinax*).

This should be a lot of fun, and it should also be fairly easy for me
to prepare for sessions:

- I have the 10 *Pirates of Drinax* adventures I can sprinkle in
  whenever feels right.
- And the 8 additional adventures from the *Drinaxian Companion* (we
  did one of those---an introductory adventure to teach the players
  the basics of space piracy---last session).
- And the 3-part mini-campaign *Shadows of Sindal*, which takes place
  in the same region of space.
- And all the sorts of troubles pirates might have: spies, pirate
  hunters, untrustworthy allies, disgruntled crew, etc.
- Plus all the random tables in the various Traveller rulebooks for
  generating random patrons, missions, ships to pirate, and various
  other sorts of encounter.
- *And* all the normal adventures that could happen in a Traveller
  campaign: just because the players are pirates now doesn't mean I
  can't throw a non-piracy adventure at them from time to time.

Space piracy gives me a lot of new material.  And really, the only
additional work it causes me is having to keep track of their
reputation (which *Pirates of Drinax* and the *Drinaxian Companion*
have systems for), as that will trigger things in the background (eg,
if the players pirate in the same region of space a lot and word gets
out, pirate hunters will arrive).

I'm very much looking forward to seeing where things go from here.

I'm also trying out a bit of an experiment.  I *was* just going to
track the various NPC and faction relationships with the party behind
the scenes, but I've decided to actually directly show the players all
that information, *and* give them handouts with the mechanics I'm
using to do so.  So the players can see, for example, that if they
bribe Lord So-and-so X million credits, then his positive relationship
with the party will jump up 3 levels, which means he'll be willing to
do tasks A, B, and C for them now.

It's very gamey.  But my hope is that it'll encourage the players to
engage more with NPCs and NPC factions if it's very clear (1) what
rewards they can get for doing so, and (2) how to effectively do so.

Matt Colville released [a video about rewards][] a few weeks ago which
advocates for doing the same sort of thing, and this is what tipped me
over the edge to doing it.

## Miscellaneous

I upgraded to Windows 11 this week, and the major differences so far
seem to be that the icons on the taskbar are centred, and all the UI
components are slightly rounder.

It feels very mid-00s Linux, specifically XFCE.
