## Work

Not much to say about this week, as I was on support for two days,
then back on the team, then off for Thursday and Friday.  It was nice
to have a little break though.  I've been toying with the idea of
taking one Friday a month off.  It's nice to have a longer (even if
only slightly) weekend every so often.


## Books

This week I read:

- [On Murderer Considered as one of the Fine Arts][], by Thomas De Quincy.

I've also been reading the second [Malazan][] book and the [RuneQuest
Glorantha][] rulebook.

I expanded [the RPG section of my book wishlist][] with some more
setting books, as it's always nice to have more to draw upon in my
games.  Running Call of Cthulhu with all the standard Mythos monsters
*works*, but can get a bit repetitive.  The last thing you want is the
players saying things like "oh, *another* Deep One."  I think The
Gardens of Ynn could work as part of a Dreamlands sequence in a Call
of Cthulhu game; that would be fun to try out.

## Games

This week I switched my Call of Cthulhu campaign to Pulp Cthulhu, and
we started playing the Masks of Nyarlathotep prologue chapter.  MoN is
a very long campaign, but the prologue is nicely self-contained, and
one of the players wants a story about Nyarlathotep, so it's a good
fit.  I think it went very well.  We got to use a few of the new Pulp
rules, and everyone had a good time.

The downside is that MoN is a long campaign, but I've been getting
into the mood to play some RuneQuest...  do I need to start a *third*
RPG group?


## Miscellaneous

I played around the new GPT-3-powered version of [AI Dungeon][], it's
pretty impressive.  I decided to start it with a very Call of
Cthulhu-esque prompt:

> Your good friend Jackson Elias calls for your help with a telegram
> scarce on details. Something about the ill-fated Carlyle Expedition
> of 1920, where everyone ended up dead. He said he's found
> something. You arrive at his hotel room and knock on the door, but
> get no response. The door is ajar. You push it open and see

And got [this cool short story][] which could easily serve as the
introduction to a game scenario.  Not bad!

I particularly like this bit:

> The old ones.  The Great Old Ones.  The Lords of the Outer Rims.
> The Elder Gods.  Gods from before the gods, some say.  They dwell in
> a realm of twisted madness that lies on the far edges of reality,
> just outside the material world.

I find that really interesting, because I can only find "Lords of the
Outer Rims" used in the context of Star Wars---so GPT-3 has recognised
that it's used in a similar context to "Great Old Ones" and "Elder
Gods" in weird fiction!
