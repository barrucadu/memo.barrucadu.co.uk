## Work

I went back to work on Wednesday this week, to find a crazy number of
emails, almost none of which I actually needed to read.  Maybe I
should set up some filter rules.

After wading through the emails, I [removed some ][docker1] [docker
stuff][docker2], which is no longer necessary now that we're using
SageMaker.  I also redid a little of the RFC work, after it turned out
that some confusion had occurred: there's going to be an amendment to
the RFC doc to clarify matters.

On Thursday afternoon, I visited the FCO to talk about searchy things.
This was my first visit to another department, which the person I was
going with found really surprising.  I think it's easy to miss out on
that sort of thing as a dev, normally it's the product managers and
content designers who go for visits.  Sadly, I didn't catch sight of
[Palmerston][], despite entering the "Palmerston Zone".

## Miscellaneous

### Books

I read volumes 4, 5, and 6 of [Overlord][], which included some good
setting information which the anime didn't really convey at all.  I
wish it were more common in book adaptations to have a narrator who
can explain things, rather than trying to convey everything visually,
or through characters awkwardly talking about things which are common
in-world knowledge, just so the viewer knows what's going on.

I ordered a few more volumes, which should be arriving next week.

### Coronavirus

I went shopping earlier, and noticed the toilet paper and hand
sanitiser sections looking a bit barren.  Earlier in the week, there
was a message sent around the whole office, saying that people have
been taking the hand sanitiser from the toilets, and to please stop.

It's a bit silly, and I hope things return to normal swiftly, when all
of the hoarders realise they've got three months of supplies.

It'll be interesting to see what the long-term effects are (other than
people dying), will remote working become more common once people have
got used to it?  Or will employers say "right, crisis over, everyone
back in the office"?


### Self organisation

I've been using fortnight-long "sprints" as part of my [self
organisation][] system for about a month now, and I think it's working
pretty well.  I'm not yet very good at estimating how much stuff I'll
get done in a sprint, but I have been more focussed in what I get
done.

It's easy to feel productive by doing a dozen small tasks, but if
there's a lot of more important tasks you're procrastinating by doing
those small tasks, are you *really* being productive?
