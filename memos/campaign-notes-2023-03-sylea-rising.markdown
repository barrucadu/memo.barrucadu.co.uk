### Handout

300,000 years ago, a mysterious race now called "the Ancients" took primitive
humans from their home planet, and seeded them throughout the galaxy.  This has
made a lot of people very angry and has been widely regarded as a bad move.

About 7,000 years ago, the Vilani people from the planet of Vland were the first
humans to discover jump technology.  They gained the ability to travel between
the stars.  Over those 7,000 years, they built up a vast empire, called the Ziru
Sirka, which means Grand Empire of the Stars.  At its height, it controlled over
15,000 worlds spread across 27 sectors of space.

In about 60 years, the Terrans from the planet of Earth will discover jump
technology.

In about 75 years, first contact will be made between the Terrans and the
Vilani.

And in about 100 years, war will break out between the Terran Confederation and
the Ziru Sirka.  The Ziru Sirka is far, far bigger, but it's also in decline.
Vilani society is very centralised, their culture is incredibly rigid, they've
stagnated technologically, and with only jump-2 ships they simply can't
effectively manage their vast territory.

The war lasts about 200 years, and ends with the surrender of the Ziru Sirka.
One imperium comes to an end, and another begins.  The Terrans---now calling
themselves Solomani after our star---proclaim the Rule of Man, a kind of
military state run by hereditary fleet admirals.

But the Solomani couldn't halt the decline of the empire they'd inherited.
After a scant 500 years, the Rule of Man collapsed.  And nothing replaced it.

That began the Long Night, a period of galactic anarchy which saw the collapse
of interstellar trade, diplomacy, and communication.  Many worlds couldn't
maintain their high technology levels, or even feed their populations, with the
overarching bureaucracy gone.  Some worlds reverted to barbarism or died out
entirely.  Space became a lawless place where pirates and reavers preyed on
those few brave enough to still travel between the stars.  And over a thousand
years passed before interstellar civilisation began to re-emerge.

One of those lights in the darkness is the Sylean Federation, now 650 years old,
and that is where our game is set.

#### Sylean Federation

**Governance:** Worlds are largely self-governing, with each appointing a
senator to the Grand Senate on Sylea, which has the hereditary Grand Duke of
Sylea as its president.

The Grand Senate determines laws for both Sylea and the whole Federation, there
isn't a separate Sylean government.  While Sylea is the only world directly
ruled by the Grand Senate, the nearby worlds of Unrair, Unkuu, Irurk, Aggii
Ganaan, Irmap Muu, Bala, Zuarkri, Kain, Zimiin, Lauursha, Laairer, Idmum, Gikuu,
and Kuunen Ish, which have been members of the Federation since the beginning,
are civil service bureaucracies ruled by their senators.  Other worlds are more
varied.

The current Grand Duke is the 56-year-old Cleon Zhunatsu, a very popular leader
who has overseen rapid expansion of the Federation.

**Society:** The core worlds are diverse and well integrated, with Syleans,
Solomani, and Vilani all mixing together in all tiers of society, though ethnic
Syleans are over-represented in the Senate.

Many of the worlds further afield are old Vilani and Solomani colonies which
haven't seen much immigration.

**Recent history:** The recent history of the Sylean Federation is the recent
history of the current ruling dynasty, the Zhunastu family.  Felix Zhunastu, the
previous Grand Duke, persuaded the Grand Senate to grant the president broad and
expansive powers.  He also used the Zhunastu family fortune to acquire several
key corporations and merge them into the Zhunastu Industries megacorporation,
which mostly deals with research and development, and holds several military
contracts.

When Felix died, he left behind his heir the 27-year-old Cleon Zhunastu, who
assumed the roles of Grand Duke of Sylea, president of the Grand Senate, and
chairman of Zhunastu Industries.

Cleon began a rapid expansion of territory, a mixture of recruitment and
conquest.  He established the Sylean Federation Scout Service.  And he's
introduced the first prototype jump-3 ships into the navy, that technology newly
developed by Zhunastu Industries.  Some of these high tech ships have been
deployed to the war with the Interstellar Confederacy, and have allowed rapid
advances and surprise attacks against the less technologically advanced
Confederates.

Cleon has been president for 30 years now, and shows no sign of slowing down.
People are generally optimistic for the future, and look forward to seeing what
change he brings next.

#### Other polities

##### Apge Free Trade Zone

This jump-1 main survived the Long Night by fostering tariff-free trade.  The
worlds are all independent and there is no overarching government or culture,
but each has signed a treaty to waive taxes when importing or exporting goods.

Mechanically speaking:

- When buying goods in the Zone, pay the normal price.
- When selling goods in the Zone which were bought *inside* the Zone, the sale
  price is 5% higher (this reflects sale taxes not being taken).
- When selling goods in the Zone which were bought *outside* the Zone, use the
  normal sale price.

**Relationship with the Sylean Federation:** As the Free Trade Zone is a
collection of independent worlds, it has no formal relationship as a whole with
the Sylean Federation.

##### Chanestin Kingdom

During the time of the Ziru Sirka, Keshi was a rich agricultural world,
exporting produce to many other nearby worlds.  So when the collapse came, it
retained a fleet of jump-1 starships and huge stockpiles of produce and
material.  About 1300 years ago, the king of Keshi used the remnants of the
fleet to conquer the nearby worlds, forming the interstellar Chanestin Kingdom.
The monarchs were not very oppressive, so no worlds have broken away over the
centuries.

**Relationship with the Sylean Federation:** Contact was established a little
over a century ago by a trade convoy, but the ruling monarch executed the
merchants for inciting sedition (or so they say).  War broke out.  At the moment
there is officially peace, but it's more like a cold war, with both polities
trying to influence the Kuusuun Federation, which lies between the two, to their
side.

##### Interstellar Confederacy

The worlds of the Confederacy survived the Long Night relatively intact by
forming a union to restore interstellar trade, provide for mutual self-defence,
and preserve the technology of their most advanced worlds.  At its peak, it had
32 member worlds.

**Relationship with the Sylean Federation:** There is an active war between the
Confederacy and the Sylean Federation, and has been almost since first contact
300 years ago.  The Syleans have captured over half of it, including recently
its capital of Uniimvlu.  The worlds closer to the frontier are ruled by Sylean
military governors, but many of the other worlds have had a limited self-rule
restored (though there are frequent check-ups by the Sylean navy).  Ultimately,
the Syleans plan to conquer and absorb the entire Confederacy.

##### Kuusuun Federation

The Kuusuun are a fragmented people, even their capital world of Kuusuu Uur has
a balkanised government.  They are slow to trust, quick to anger, and family
ties are very important: some say the quickest way to befriend a Kuusuun is to
marry his sister; but if you insult a Kuusuun, the blood feud will last for
generations.

The Kuusuun Federation is also home to Kala Station, an aging Vilani wreck
constructed during the Ziru Sirka.  It's falling apart, but it forms an
essential bridge between Iruies and Raami, as the Kuusuun have very few jump-2
ships and little capacity to make more.

**Relationship with the Sylean Federation:** Both Sylean and Chanestin diplomats
are trying to persuade the Kuusuun to join their respective side, and Sylean and
Chanestin intelligence agents are trying to stop the other side from getting
there first.  The Kuusuun Federation is the unwitting site of a proxy war
between these two greater powers.

##### Mishaar Cluster

The relatively high-tech but resource-poor Mishaar saved itself from starvation
by seizing the resource-rich asteroid belts of Dis and establishing automated
farms on Gipirkash.  Now, most of the population live on the worlds of Kargi and
Uumaad Nurir, but the beating heart is still the automation and shipping run
from Mishaar.

**Relationship with the Sylean Federation:** The Cluster is on the Sylea / Vland
trade route and has profited greatly from passing ships.  They are considering
applying for membership of the Federation.

#### Independent worlds

In addition to these larger polities, there are many independent worlds.  These
are intentionally not fleshed out.  Dead worlds, archaeological finds, hostile
aliens, strange facilities, caches of technology... anything could be out there.

### Prep

1. Go through setting handout
2. Discuss points
3. Create characters

#### Discussion

##### Campaign

- No overarching story
- The world doesn't resolve around the PCs
- Time skips to get straight to the action:
  - I think playing out every moment harmed the previous campaign
- Episodic, but scope for player goals
- How long should the campaign last?
- Tone:
  - What kind of conflicts and adventures make sense for this game?
  - What kind of outcomes make sense for this game?
  - What kind of PCs make sense for this game?
  - How do NPCs generally think of the PCs?
  - Ethics (sexism, racism, slavery, etc): use it to make the bad guys obviously
    bad? Anything off limits?
  - Can PCs die?  How frequently?
    - What happens if there's a TPK?
- Choose a group of 4 subsectors

##### Characters

- Boon Dice in character creation
- Alien PCs, yay or nay?
- Psion PCs, yay or nay?
  - What about psion NPCs?
- Advancement:
  - How did everyone feel about the standard rules?  I felt it penalised
    characters with low EDU too much.
  - Seth Skorkowsky house rule: mark skills which get used successfully, at the
    end of the adventure roll `1d6-1` for each marked skill and gain 1
    experience point if above the skill level.  Gaining a skill at level 0, or
    taking it from level 0 to level 1, costs 1xp; costs double each level
    thereafter.

### Notes

### Next time

- Prepare local region:
  - Upload Foundry map
  - Flesh out major factions, worlds, and NPCs
- Murder on Arcturus Station:
  - Pick a border world and tie it into Sylean politics
