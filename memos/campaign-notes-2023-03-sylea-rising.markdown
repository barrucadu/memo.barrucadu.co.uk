Pitch
-----

> The Ziru Sirka, the great interstellar empire of the Vilani, lasted for two
> thousand years.  But inability to manage such a large expanse of territory
> caused a slow decline, which ultimately led to its conquest by the Terrans,
> and the establishment of their great interstellar empire: the Rule of Man.
>
> But the Rule of Man lasted a scant few centuries before it, too, collapsed
> under its own weight.  This time, nothing replaced it.  The galaxy fell into
> anarchy, worlds were cut off from one another, technologies were lost, and
> many civilisations simply failed to survive: this is the Long Night, and this
> is when our game is set.
>
> In the Long Night many small pocket empires rose, and fell.  You are all
> scouts, ex-military, and similar sorts, employed by the government of the
> Sylean Federation, one of the larger pocket empires of the Long Night.  It's
> survived for 650 years now, but Sylea, too, is feeling the strain of
> administration at interstellar distances, and is also currently at war with
> two other pocket empires: the Interstellar Confederacy and the Chanestin
> Kingdom.  Can Sylea solve its problems, or will it perish like so many others?
>
> **Player buy-in:** The player characters are all explorers working government
> contracts to reach out to worlds not heard from in centuries (or millennia),
> to establish peaceful relations where possible, or maybe just to plunder them
> if the world is dead---after all, who's to say you handed in *everything* you
> found to the government inspectors?  It's post-apocalypse in space.  There
> will be space dungeons.  But it's also about the rise of the Sylean Federation
> into something even greater, so there's plenty of scope for this to turn into
> a more political game if you want.
