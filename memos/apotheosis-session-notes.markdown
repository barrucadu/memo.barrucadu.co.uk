Apotheosis is a homebrew setting for [Apocalypse World][], 2nd
edition.  These are the tales of our survival.

[Apocalypse World]: http://apocalypse-world.com/


Player characters
-----------------

* **Commander Gustav Zagan**, the hardholder.  Likes everything to be
  ordered and as it should be, and rules Apotheosis with an iron fist
  to achieve that.  He keeps the people united by scaring them with
  stories of the mutants living in the wasteland, who he portrays as
  like [Firefly-style reavers][].

* **Dodge**, the driver.  Very mercenary, and known for being able to
  get risky jobs done, for the right price.  Her other car is a tank.

* **Grigsby delBarco**, the news.  An odd figure, wears an
  old-fashioned suit and keeps to himself in his radio shack,
  broadcasting "Technical Difficulties", his show.  Fancies himself a
  playwright, and tries to write moral plays; but they're always
  slightly off.  Has a prosthetic throat which crackles with static,
  makes it sound like he's always speaking over the radio, and
  prevents him from eating solid food.

* **Leah Morrel**, the savvyhead.  Laid claim to a hangar, which she
  uses as her workshop, and is secretly constructing a WWII-era plane
  in.  Lives in the radio shack with **Grigsby delBarco**.

* **Oi**, the child-thing.  Ambiguously gendered[^pronoun].  Travels
  the wastes to avoid the Wolves, and is currently living in the attic
  of the radio shack in Apotheosis.  Called "Oi" because that's what
  people shout after her.

* **Ruby Monsoon**, the battlebabe.  Often found in bars, drinking and
  playing with her seemingly endless collection of knives.  Has a
  friendly rivalry with **Dodge**.

[^pronoun]: But I'm going to use female pronouns because "they" and
  "them" get really awkward.

The Setting
-----------

### The Apocalypse

Nobody knows what happened, but they do know the effects.  The world
is as it was, mostly, but all the rain is acid, and heavy downpours
are common.  You don't want to get caught out in one of those without
protection, and you *definitely* don't want to drink the untreated
water.

Some plants and animals have adapted biologically, becoming resistant
to the acid.  Others live in shelter their entire lives.  Those which
could do neither have died off.  The acid-adapted plants and animals
can be eaten, but they don't taste good.

Some humans have adapted too, becoming the mutants living out in the
wastes.  They have varying degrees of mental acuity: some are almost
human, others are little more than feral beasts.  They tend to live in
small groups, the more human ones form camps, the more feral ones form
hunting packs.

Zagan portrays them all as mindless monsters, to unite the people of
Apotheosis with a shared fear and loathing.

### The Hold

Apotheosis[^name] itself is an old military air base which Zagan laid
claim to and built up.  Situated with the wastes to the west and other
human settlements a few miles to the east.  It mostly gets by with
raiding other settlements, both human and mutant.  Some hunting,
scavenging, and crude farming fill the gaps.

[^name]: Also known as Hope City.

It's a large base, with between 75 and 150 people living there at any
time, there's not been an accurate count done in a while.  It's
well-armed too, with both weapons and specialised battle vehicles.
Zagan keeps order with his gang of 40 savage bastards, who he somehow
keeps control of, for now...

Food and other resources are rationed, with everyone getting what they
need.  For more special fare, bullets serve as the *de facto*
currency, both within Apotheosis itself and in the wider world.

### The Environs

To the west is the wastes.  Rocky, hilly, and barren; inhabited by
mutated animals and men, adapted to deal with the toxic water.
Occasionally Apotheosis sends out squads to cull the mutant camps.

To the east is Malice, a town occupied by various disunited gangs.
Apotheosis' prime raiding target, as no one group is strong enough to
stand up to it.  Rumours have it that a new boss is in town though,
uniting the gangs under one rule.

To the south is Mistfield Farm, a small religious community who supply
food to Apotheosis in exchange for protection.  Zagan engineered this
relationship by showing up just in the nick of time to save the
faithful from a band of raiders, what a nice guy.  What they don't
know is that Zagan enticed the raiders in the first place.


Session 0, 2020-02-29
---------------------

<aside class="highlight">
This was a short session to get some establishing shots of the
characters.
</aside>

It's a fine morning with no current acid rain, though it has rained
overnight.

Zagan is out supervising repair works on the fence, which was damaged
in a recent mutant raid.  The workers are very organised, with no
arguments or brawling, just getting on with the task.  As he likes it.

*Meanwhile...*

Leah wakes up in her messy bedroom in the radio shack, atop the pile
of clothes she uses for a bed.  She's not been living there for long,
only a few months; maybe a year at most.  She goes out into the
kitchen and rummages through the fridge for some breakfast: a
delicious can of spam, hiding at the back, behind the tubes of
Grigsby's weird nutrient paste.  As she opens the can, she becomes
aware of the crackle of static, and turns around to see Grigsby.  Leah
chucks him a food-paste-tube and eats her disgusting spam.

When she's done with it, a cupboard opens and Oi peeks out.  "You
gonna use that?"  Leah shakes her head and passes the can to Oi, who
disappears out the front door and scrambles up the front of the
building.  Leah looks in the cupboard Oi came from: there's no obvious
hidden entrance.

Leah decides to go to the warehouse to get some parts for her project:
she's been building a WWII-era plane in her workshop, and it's nearly
done.  She's been stealing parts to work on it, but is worried people
have started to catch on.  Got to play it honest from now on and just
get parts legitimately.  All she needs now is an engine, and she can
go flying through the sky, free of this place.  She doesn't want Zagan
to know about the plane though, as he'll come up with some nasty
military use for it.

The warehouse is the domain of Foster, the quartermaster.  Harsh and
inflexible, but he'll give you what you want as long as you're not
taking more than your fair share.  He's Zagan's man to a T.  As Leah
is negotiating with Foster for an engine---*just* an engine, she
doesn't want word getting out that she's looking for a *plane
engine*---Zagan himself shows up, drinking a cup of cheap instant
coffee.  Well, it was cheap, in the old days, now it's a luxury item,
and he sends out raiding parties just to stock up.

Zagan's arrival unnerves Leah, but he doesn't talk.  He just watches
her go get the engine, and stagger out the warehouse back towards her
hangar.  When she's half way there he hands his mug to Foster, in much
the same way you'd put it down on a table, and strides after her.
"Need a hand?"  She thanks him, but he follows anyway, only turning to
go after she's inside the hangar.

*Meanwhile...*

Ruby and Dodge wake up in the bar, in a pile of empty cans and
discarded peanut shells.  There's nobody else there.  Ruby got back
last night from a secret mission for Zagan---getting more coffee---and
the first thing she did was challenge Dodge to a drinking contest.
She groans, and heads off to deliver her secret package, though
Grigsby's voice over the radio is now saying "Folks, rumour has it
that a new shipment of coffee arrived in Apotheosis today!"

Dodge is still struggling to move when Dinnerlady, the man who runs
the bar and canteen, arrives to set up for the day.  "You look like
shit, go clean up." He throws a packet of peanuts to her and starts
polishing glasses.

*That evening...*

Oi stands on the roof of the warehouse, as she often does, looking out
across the waste.  She opens her mind, trying to sense the
Wolves... and knows instantly that one is to the east, a few miles
away.

A few minutes later, Zagan hears Oi's voice through the panels of his
ceiling warning him to watch out for "them".  Oi has spoken to him
like this before, but she's never shown herself.


Session 1, 2020-03-14
---------------------

It's a wet afternoon here in Apotheosis.  It's been raining pretty
heavily for the past few days, and so people have been keeping
indoors.  Now that it's cleared up, people are emerging from their
homes, some are going 'round inspecting the buildings for any damage,
their thick boots squelching in the acidic mud.

But first, it's time for Grigsby's broadcast:

> Hello, Listeners.
>
> That was, of course, *Frank Sinatra: The World We Knew*.
>
> In Frank's world, stars are signs to be read and the sun and moon

>
> And now, it's my favourite part of the show: fan mail time---and
> this time I'm especially excited because we have some mail!
>
> I think this one is for me; it's addressed "Grigsby you pathetic

> right idea trying to shut you up.  One day soon, I'm going to finish
> the job, if someone else doesn't beat me to it.  Stay scared,
> snitch, won't be long now.  Innkeeper's coming for you."
>
> So thanks to Innkeeper for your letter---it's fan mail like this

>
> I tell you, it always warms my heart to see new life brought into
> the world.  So before I close today's show with another classic, I'd
> just like to wish everyone a happy birthday.
>
> Stay tuned, stay safe, stay sane.
>
> Here's one for the little baby mutant, *The Ink Spots: It's All Over
> but the Crying*.

Commander Zagan paces back and forth in his office, concerned by the
food situation in Apotheosis.  Supplies are running low.  He sends a
man to fetch Grigsby, to see if his informants have heard any rumours
of new targets.

A little later, Grigsby arrives, pausing in the corridor outside the
waiting room; Miss Vine, Zagan's weird creepy secretary is there,
making some coffee at her desk.  He composes himself, and tries to
walk through the room to the office door without acknowledging her or
drawing her attention at all.  Unfortunately for him, she looks up at
him, she looks up *through* him, and says "the commander is expecting
you, Grigsby, I'll check if he's ready."

Zagan hears a knocking, and opens his door.  It's Miss Vine, holding
his coffee, with Grigsby anxiously standing behind her.  He takes the
coffee and invites Grigsby in.  Grigsby presses against the doorframe,
trying to squeeze through as far from Miss Vine as he can get.

With the door shut, Grigsby calms down, and looks around at the office
for anything that's changed since he was last here.  There's just one
thing, a small golden figure of a bull.  Following his gaze, Zagan
comments that Dodge picked it up on a recent raid.  They make some
small talk.  Neither have seen a bull in real life.  "It's hard to
imagine what they used such small creatures for," one says, assuming
it's life-sized.

Zagan then gets to the point.  Because he and Grigsby have some
history, he can be very frank about the situation.  Apotheosis is not
in a good place right now, and if demand keeps up as it has... well,
best not to think about that.  Grigsby says that one of his informants
is due to report in later in the day, and he's expecting a tip about a
new settlement.  But there's a price: he wants to be paid, and he
wants the new mutant-baby to live.

Bad then turns to worse as one of the gardeners, Balls, shows up with
the news that a greenhouse got damaged in the storm, and the rain
killed a bunch of the crops.

Zagan and Grigsby argue back and forth a bit, and eventually settle on
Grigsby being paid, and Zagan being noncommittal about the baby.
"Well, *I* won't order anything done, but I may not have as tight a
rein on my men as you seem to think...."  he says.

*Meanwhile...*

Leah goes over to her workshop for the first time in days, to find the
padlock smashed clean off the door.  Someone broke in and they weren't
subtle about it.  She carefully opens the door, looking and listening
for anyone inside.  She edges over to the light switch, and flicks it
on...

Nothing happens.

But something *has* happened: three of the jeeps have been smashed up
pretty bad.  Fortunately it looks all cosmetic---dented bodies and
broken windows---and these weren't the prettiest of vehicles to start
with.  The plane is fine.

"That's pretty damaged," Oi says, appearing out of nowhere.  She
didn't see what happened.

Leah decides to open her mind to the maelstrom and try to sense what
happened.  It's normally a calm experience: there's a sensation of
freefall, then exhilaration as she soars through a blue sky.  Perhaps
this is where she got the idea to make the plane from.  She feels
strong emotions, senses a voice, and sees someone holding a hammer.
It's Newton, a scrawny little twerp who's been watching her lately.
Seems he's got a crush and doesn't know how to express it, but it's
gone way too far now.

Newton lives somewhere in the dorms, so she heads off to find him, Oi
in tow.

Unlike many of the buildings in Apotheosis, which have been adapted
from their original purpose, the dorms were clearly built as dorms.
But now they're way more densely populated than they'd been designed
for, and any spare spaces---like laundry and storage rooms---are being
used as homes.  The space between the four big buildings serves as a
kind of outdoor social space.

It takes a little hunting, but she finally finds herself outside a
door scrawled with "Newton" in some sort of paint.  She knocks on the
door, sees the peephole darken and then lighten again as if someone
briefly looked through it.  The door doesn't open.  "Hey Newton, I
know you're in there!" she yells as she bangs on the door.

Eventually it opens a crack, and a scrawny little guy, mid teens at
most, peers out at her.  It's Newton.  At first he feigns ignorance
but, under her continued stare and verbal harangue, eventually gives
in and admits "I just wanted to be noticed".  The door swings open a
little wider, and he passes the hammer to Leah.  "Don't ever let me
catch you back at my workshop again!"

*Later...*

Grigsby is sat in the shack, at the appointed time.  On the door
sounds the appointed knock.  Grigsby opens it, to reveal Dune, one of
his informants.  They talk a bit about the situation in Malice,
"almost nobody's seen the new boss, but rumour says he's not very big
or tough looking... but something about him scares people, and they do
what he says."  Then they move onto the topic of a new farm, Mistfield
Farm, which a bunch of religious nuts started to the south.  It's been
there for about a month now, and they're preparing fields for crops.
Grigsby decides this is just the sort of thing Zagan is looking for.

*Later...*

Zagan, Dodge, and some of the thugs are driving south to the farm.
Since she's got company, Dodge gets out the *fancy* whisky for this
trip, offering some to Zagan, then taking a swig for herself, without
taking her eyes off the road.  Much.

It's not long before they get their first sight of Mistfield Farm:
wooden buildings, outdoor fields---that's unusual, people normally use
greenhouses---covered by a makeshift gazebo and surrounded by a ditch
to catch the rain, and a few people doing construction or working in
the fields.  One man approaches as they pull up.  He introduces
himself as Brother Grome and, after learning who they are and where
they came from, asks what their visit is for.  Zagan wastes no time in
getting to it: he wants them to supply Apotheosis with food.  In
exchange, they'll protect the farm from raiders, who will certainly be
coming once word of an undefended food source gets out.

Brother Grome doesn't really see the point.  They've been here for a
month now without being bothered and, besides, they have God on their
side.  What do they have to fear?

Zagan sees that they're getting nowhere, makes his excuses, and the
gang head back to Apotheosis.

*Back in Apotheosis...*

Zagan shows up at the radio shack, and has Grigsby mention the farm in
his next broadcast.  Not exactly *telling* people that it's undefended
and would be a good target, but certainly hinting it.

*That evening...*

Leah checks the storehouse again for a plane engine, in case one has
come in in the last few days.  But there's still nothing.  So she goes
to find Dodge.

Dodge is in the bar, which is called The Rattlesnake, surrounded by
empty glasses, bottles, cans, and packets of peanuts as usual.  Leah
carefully broaches the subject, saying that this has to be kept a
secret from Zagan, "sure, it's not like I tell that guy everything,
what's up?"

Dodge has a few likely places she can check for an engine, and all she
wants as payment is to have a go at flying it.  And what Zagan doesn't
know won't hurt him.

*Meanwhile...*

Oi is in her lair, the attic and ventilation pipes of the radio shack.
She's listening to a radio that only she can hear, which speaks about
another world.  Satisfied with what she has heard, she leaves her lair
and goes to the store.  She's noticed, but nobody says anything to
her.  After looking around a bit, she finds what she's looking for:
some discarded packaging material.  She takes some string, and returns
to her lair.

She eats the string, and feels happy.

*A few days later...*

An orange flare is seen to the south: the signal, sent by one of
Zagan's men left behind, that there are raiders approaching the farm.
Apotheosis sets forth with a small gang in tanks.  Almost everyone is
along for the ride: Zagan and Dodge and leading the charge, Grigsby is
there with a portable radio kit to broadcast that the farm is now
under Apotheosis protection, and Leah is there in case any repairs are
needed.

They arrive to find six raiders terrorising the farm.  Some buildings
are on fire, there's been fighting, and crates of supplies are being
carried off as the religious nuts protest.  Apotheosis forces, which
outnumber the raiders, advance and start to take control of the
situation.

It looks pretty safe now, so Leah gets out of her tank to fix some
damaged tread but while she's distracted doing that, a seventh raider
sneaks up and grabs her, holding a gun to her head.  He yells to "call
off your men, or I'll shoot!"

Zagan pops his head out of his tank and keeps the man talking while
his troops capture the others.  He then says "now run off and tell any
of your other friends that this place is under my protection!"  The
raider quickly glances behind himself, backs up some more, then shoves
Leah forward and runs off.

This time, Zagan doesn't have any difficulty convincing Brother Grome
that they need his protection.  He has Grigsby broadcast a message
that if you mess with Mistfield Farm you mess with Apotheosis, and
gives some flare guns to Brother Grome to signal Apotheosis with if
they're attacked again.
