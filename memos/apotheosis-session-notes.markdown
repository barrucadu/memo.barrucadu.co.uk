Apotheosis is a homebrew setting for [Apocalypse World][], 2nd
edition.  These are the tales of our survival.

[Apocalypse World]: http://apocalypse-world.com/


Player characters
-----------------

* **Commander Gustav Zagan**, the hardholder.  Likes everything to be
  ordered and as it should be, and rules Apotheosis with an iron fist
  to achieve that.  He keeps the people united by scaring them with
  stories of the mutants living in the wasteland, who he portrays as
  like [Firefly-style reavers][].

* **Dodge**, the driver.  Very mercenary, and known for being able to
  get risky jobs done, for the right price.  Her other car is a tank.

* **Grigsby delBarco**, the news.  An odd figure, wears an
  old-fashioned suit and keeps to himself in his radio shack,
  broadcasting "Technical Difficulties", his show.  Fancies himself a
  playwright, and tries to write moral plays; but they're always
  slightly off.  Has a prosthetic throat which crackles with static,
  makes it sound like he's always speaking over the radio, and
  prevents him from eating solid food.

* **Leah Morrel**, the savvyhead.  Laid claim to a hangar, which she
  uses as her workshop, and is secretly constructing a WWII-era plane
  in.  Lives in the radio shack with **Grigsby delBarco**.

* **Oi**, the child-thing.  Ambiguously gendered[^pronoun].  Travels
  the wastes to avoid the Wolves, and is currently living in the attic
  of the radio shack in Apotheosis.  Called "Oi" because that's what
  people shout after her.

* **Ruby Monsoon**, the battlebabe.  Often found in bars, drinking and
  playing with her seemingly endless collection of knives.  Has a
  friendly rivalry with **Dodge**.

[^pronoun]: But I'm going to use female pronouns because "they" and
  "them" get really awkward.

The Setting
-----------

### The Apocalypse

Nobody knows what happened, but they do know the effects.  The world
is as it was, mostly, but all the rain is acid, and heavy downpours
are common.  You don't want to get caught out in one of those without
protection, and you *definitely* don't want to drink the untreated
water.

Some plants and animals have adapted biologically, becoming resistant
to the acid.  Others live in shelter their entire lives.  Those which
could do neither have died off.  The acid-adapted plants and animals
can be eaten, but they don't taste good.

Some humans have adapted too, becoming the mutants living out in the
wastes.  They have varying degrees of mental acuity: some are almost
human, others are little more than feral beasts.  They tend to live in
small groups, the more human ones form camps, the more feral ones form
hunting packs.

Zagan portrays them all as mindless monsters, to unite the people of
Apotheosis with a shared fear and loathing.

### The Hold

Apotheosis[^name] itself is an old military air base which Zagan laid
claim to and built up.  Situated with the wastes to the west and other
human settlements a few miles to the east.  It mostly gets by with
raiding other settlements, both human and mutant.  Some hunting,
scavenging, and crude farming fill the gaps.

[^name]: Also known as Hope City.

It's a large base, with between 75 and 150 people living there at any
time, there's not been an accurate count done in a while.  It's
well-armed too, with both weapons and specialised battle vehicles.
Zagan keeps order with his gang of 40 savage bastards, who he somehow
keeps control of, for now...

Food and other resources are rationed, with everyone getting what they
need.  For more special fare, bullets serve as the *de facto*
currency, both within Apotheosis itself and in the wider world.

### The Environs

To the west is the wastes.  Rocky, hilly, and barren; inhabited by
mutated animals and men, adapted to deal with the toxic water.
Occasionally Apotheosis sends out squads to cull the mutant camps.

To the east is Malice, a town which was occupied by various disunited
gangs.  It was Apotheosis' prime raiding target, as no one group was
strong enough to stand up to it.  But, some weeks ago, a new boss
arrived in town, and united the gangs under one rule.  Now they're a
force to be reckoned with.

To the south is Mistfield Farm, a small religious community who supply
food to Apotheosis in exchange for protection.  Zagan engineered this
relationship by showing up just in the nick of time to save the
faithful from a band of raiders, what a nice guy.  What they don't
know is that Zagan enticed the raiders in the first place.


Session 0, 2020-02-29
---------------------

<aside class="highlight">
This was a short session to get some establishing shots of the
characters.
</aside>

It's a fine morning with no current acid rain, though it has rained
overnight.

Zagan is out supervising repair works on the fence, which was damaged
in a recent mutant raid.  The workers are very organised, with no
arguments or brawling, just getting on with the task.  As he likes it.

*Meanwhile...*

Leah wakes up in her messy bedroom in the radio shack, atop the pile
of clothes she uses for a bed.  She's not been living there for long,
only a few months; maybe a year at most.  She goes out into the
kitchen and rummages through the fridge for some breakfast: a
delicious can of spam, hiding at the back, behind the tubes of
Grigsby's weird nutrient paste.  As she opens the can, she becomes
aware of the crackle of static, and turns around to see Grigsby.  Leah
chucks him a food-paste-tube and eats her disgusting spam.

When she's done with it, a cupboard opens and Oi peeks out.  "You
gonna use that?"  Leah shakes her head and passes the can to Oi, who
disappears out the front door and scrambles up the front of the
building.  Leah looks in the cupboard Oi came from: there's no obvious
hidden entrance.

Leah decides to go to the warehouse to get some parts for her project:
she's been building a WWII-era plane in her workshop, and it's nearly
done.  She's been stealing parts to work on it, but is worried people
have started to catch on.  Got to play it honest from now on and just
get parts legitimately.  All she needs now is an engine, and she can
go flying through the sky, free of this place.  She doesn't want Zagan
to know about the plane though, as he'll come up with some nasty
military use for it.

The warehouse is the domain of Foster, the quartermaster.  Harsh and
inflexible, but he'll give you what you want as long as you're not
taking more than your fair share.  He's Zagan's man to a T.  As Leah
is negotiating with Foster for an engine---*just* an engine, she
doesn't want word getting out that she's looking for a *plane
engine*---Zagan himself shows up, drinking a cup of cheap instant
coffee.  Well, it was cheap, in the old days, now it's a luxury item,
and he sends out raiding parties just to stock up.

Zagan's arrival unnerves Leah, but he doesn't talk.  He just watches
her go get the engine, and stagger out the warehouse back towards her
hangar.  When she's half way there he hands his mug to Foster, in much
the same way you'd put it down on a table, and strides after her.
"Need a hand?"  She thanks him, but he follows anyway, only turning to
go after she's inside the hangar.

*Meanwhile...*

Ruby and Dodge wake up in the bar, in a pile of empty cans and
discarded peanut shells.  There's nobody else there.  Ruby got back
last night from a secret mission for Zagan---getting more coffee---and
the first thing she did was challenge Dodge to a drinking contest.
She groans, and heads off to deliver her secret package, though
Grigsby's voice over the radio is now saying "Folks, rumour has it
that a new shipment of coffee arrived in Apotheosis today!"

Dodge is still struggling to move when Dinnerlady, the man who runs
the bar and canteen, arrives to set up for the day.  "You look like
shit, go clean up." He throws a packet of peanuts to her and starts
polishing glasses.

*That evening...*

Oi stands on the roof of the warehouse, as she often does, looking out
across the waste.  She opens her mind, trying to sense the
Wolves... and knows instantly that one is to the east, a few miles
away.

A few minutes later, Zagan hears Oi's voice through the panels of his
ceiling warning him to watch out for "them".  Oi has spoken to him
like this before, but she's never shown herself.


Session 1, 2020-03-14
---------------------

It's a wet afternoon here in Apotheosis.  It's been raining pretty
heavily for the past few days, and so people have been keeping
indoors.  Now that it's cleared up, people are emerging from their
homes, some are going 'round inspecting the buildings for any damage,
their thick boots squelching in the acidic mud.

But first, it's time for Grigsby's broadcast:

> Hello, Listeners.
>
> That was, of course, *Frank Sinatra: The World We Knew*.
>
> In Frank's world, stars are signs to be read and the sun and moon
> are things to be owned.  His hands held dreams and his feet turned

>
> And now, it's my favourite part of the show: fan mail time---and
> this time I'm especially excited because we have some mail!
>
> I think this one is for me; it's addressed "Grigsby you pathetic

> So thanks to Innkeeper for your letter---it's fan mail like this

>
> I tell you, it always warms my heart to see new life brought into

> just like to wish everyone a happy birthday.
>
> Stay tuned, stay safe, stay sane.
>
> Here's one for the little baby mutant, *The Ink Spots: It's All Over
> but the Crying*.

Commander Zagan paces back and forth in his office, concerned by the
food situation in Apotheosis.  Supplies are running low.  He sends a
man to fetch Grigsby, to see if his informants have heard any rumours
of new targets.

A little later, Grigsby arrives, pausing in the corridor outside the
waiting room; Miss Vine, Zagan's weird creepy secretary is there,
making some coffee at her desk.  He composes himself, and tries to
walk through the room to the office door without acknowledging her or
drawing her attention at all.  Unfortunately for him, she looks up at
him, she looks up *through* him, and says "the commander is expecting
you, Grigsby, I'll check if he's ready."

Zagan hears a knocking, and opens his door.  It's Miss Vine, holding
his coffee, with Grigsby anxiously standing behind her.  He takes the
coffee and invites Grigsby in.  Grigsby presses against the doorframe,
trying to squeeze through as far from Miss Vine as he can get.

With the door shut, Grigsby calms down, and looks around at the office
for anything that's changed since he was last here.  There's just one
thing, a small golden figure of a bull.  Following his gaze, Zagan
comments that Dodge picked it up on a recent raid.  They make some
small talk.  Neither have seen a bull in real life.  "It's hard to
imagine what they used such small creatures for," one says, assuming
it's life-sized.

Zagan then gets to the point.  Because he and Grigsby have some
history, he can be very frank about the situation.  Apotheosis is not
in a good place right now, and if demand keeps up as it has... well,
best not to think about that.  Grigsby says that one of his informants
is due to report in later in the day, and he's expecting a tip about a
new settlement.  But there's a price: he wants to be paid, and he
wants the new mutant-baby to live.

Bad then turns to worse as one of the gardeners, Balls, shows up with
the news that a greenhouse got damaged in the storm, and the rain
killed a bunch of the crops.

Zagan and Grigsby argue back and forth a bit, and eventually settle on
Grigsby being paid, and Zagan being noncommittal about the baby.
"Well, *I* won't order anything done, but I may not have as tight a
rein on my men as you seem to think...."  he says.

*Meanwhile...*

Leah goes over to her workshop for the first time in days, to find the
padlock smashed clean off the door.  Someone broke in and they weren't
subtle about it.  She carefully opens the door, looking and listening
for anyone inside.  She edges over to the light switch, and flicks it
on...

Nothing happens.

But something *has* happened: three of the jeeps have been smashed up
pretty bad.  Fortunately it looks all cosmetic---dented bodies and
broken windows---and these weren't the prettiest of vehicles to start
with.  The plane is fine.

"That's pretty damaged," Oi says, appearing out of nowhere.  She
didn't see what happened.

Leah decides to open her mind to the maelstrom and try to sense what
happened.  It's normally a calm experience: there's a sensation of
freefall, then exhilaration as she soars through a blue sky.  Perhaps
this is where she got the idea to make the plane from.  She feels
strong emotions, senses a voice, and sees someone holding a hammer.
It's Newton, a scrawny little twerp who's been watching her lately.
Seems he's got a crush and doesn't know how to express it, but it's
gone way too far now.

Newton lives somewhere in the dorms, so she heads off to find him, Oi
in tow.

Unlike many of the buildings in Apotheosis, which have been adapted
from their original purpose, the dorms were clearly built as dorms.
But now they're way more densely populated than they'd been designed
for, and any spare spaces---like laundry and storage rooms---are being
used as homes.  The space between the four big buildings serves as a
kind of outdoor social space.

It takes a little hunting, but she finally finds herself outside a
door scrawled with "Newton" in some sort of paint.  She knocks on the
door, sees the peephole darken and then lighten again as if someone
briefly looked through it.  The door doesn't open.  "Hey Newton, I
know you're in there!" she yells as she bangs on the door.

Eventually it opens a crack, and a scrawny little guy, mid teens at
most, peers out at her.  It's Newton.  At first he feigns ignorance
but, under her continued stare and verbal harangue, eventually gives
in and admits "I just wanted to be noticed".  The door swings open a
little wider, and he passes the hammer to Leah.  "Don't ever let me
catch you back at my workshop again!"

*Later...*

Grigsby is sat in the shack, at the appointed time.  On the door
sounds the appointed knock.  Grigsby opens it, to reveal Dune, one of
his informants.  They talk a bit about the situation in Malice,
"almost nobody's seen the new boss, but rumour says he's not very big
or tough looking... but something about him scares people, and they do
what he says."  Then they move onto the topic of a new farm, Mistfield
Farm, which a bunch of religious nuts started to the south.  It's been
there for about a month now, and they're preparing fields for crops.
Grigsby decides this is just the sort of thing Zagan is looking for.

*Later...*

Zagan, Dodge, and some of the thugs are driving south to the farm.
Since she's got company, Dodge gets out the *fancy* whisky for this
trip, offering some to Zagan, then taking a swig for herself, without
taking her eyes off the road.  Much.

It's not long before they get their first sight of Mistfield Farm:
wooden buildings, outdoor fields---that's unusual, people normally use
greenhouses---covered by a makeshift gazebo and surrounded by a ditch
to catch the rain, and a few people doing construction or working in
the fields.  One man approaches as they pull up.  He introduces
himself as Brother Grome and, after learning who they are and where
they came from, asks what their visit is for.  Zagan wastes no time in
getting to it: he wants them to supply Apotheosis with food.  In
exchange, they'll protect the farm from raiders, who will certainly be
coming once word of an undefended food source gets out.

Brother Grome doesn't really see the point.  They've been here for a
month now without being bothered and, besides, they have God on their
side.  What do they have to fear?

Zagan sees that they're getting nowhere, makes his excuses, and the
gang head back to Apotheosis.

*Back in Apotheosis...*

Zagan shows up at the radio shack, and has Grigsby mention the farm in
his next broadcast.  Not exactly *telling* people that it's undefended
and would be a good target, but certainly hinting it.

*That evening...*

Leah checks the storehouse again for a plane engine, in case one has
come in in the last few days.  But there's still nothing.  So she goes
to find Dodge.

Dodge is in the bar, which is called The Rattlesnake, surrounded by
empty glasses, bottles, cans, and packets of peanuts as usual.  Leah
carefully broaches the subject, saying that this has to be kept a
secret from Zagan, "sure, it's not like I tell that guy everything,
what's up?"

Dodge has a few likely places she can check for an engine, and all she
wants as payment is to have a go at flying it.  And what Zagan doesn't
know won't hurt him.

*Meanwhile...*

Oi is in her lair, the attic and ventilation pipes of the radio shack.
She's listening to a radio that only she can hear, which speaks about
another world.  Satisfied with what she has heard, she leaves her lair
and goes to the store.  She's noticed, but nobody says anything to
her.  After looking around a bit, she finds what she's looking for:
some discarded packaging material.  She takes some string, and returns
to her lair.

She eats the string, and feels happy.

*A few days later...*

An orange flare is seen to the south: the signal, sent by one of
Zagan's men left behind, that there are raiders approaching the farm.
Apotheosis sets forth with a small gang in tanks.  Almost everyone is
along for the ride: Zagan and Dodge and leading the charge, Grigsby is
there with a portable radio kit to broadcast that the farm is now
under Apotheosis protection, and Leah is there in case any repairs are
needed.

They arrive to find six raiders terrorising the farm.  Some buildings
are on fire, there's been fighting, and crates of supplies are being
carried off as the religious nuts protest.  Apotheosis forces, which
outnumber the raiders, advance and start to take control of the
situation.

It looks pretty safe now, so Leah gets out of her tank to fix some
damaged tread but while she's distracted doing that, a seventh raider
sneaks up and grabs her, holding a gun to her head.  He yells to "call
off your men, or I'll shoot!"

Zagan pops his head out of his tank and keeps the man talking while
his troops capture the others.  He then says "now run off and tell any
of your other friends that this place is under my protection!"  The
raider quickly glances behind himself, backs up some more, then shoves
Leah forward and runs off.

This time, Zagan doesn't have any difficulty convincing Brother Grome
that they need his protection.  He has Grigsby broadcast a message
that if you mess with Mistfield Farm you mess with Apotheosis, and
gives some flare guns to Brother Grome to signal Apotheosis with if
they're attacked again.


Session 2, 2020-03-28
---------------------

Last time, Apotheosis faced a potential food crisis, but Grigsby and
Commander Zagan used their twisted minds to threaten a religious
commune into supplying food to Apotheosis in exchange for protection.
Also, Dodge agreed to help Leah find a plane engine, for the low price
of letting her fly it, at least a few times.  And Oi ate some string.

But first, it's time for Grigsby's broadcast:

Grigsby eyes Leah over breakfast.  He know's she's up to something.

*Flashback to the night before, Grigsby reviewing his security camera
footage and seeing Leah's comings and goings.*

He can smell a story, and wants to get involved.  But when asked, she
just deflects the question, poorly, and escapes outside.  Grigsby
follows, and sees her meeting with Dodge, "I think Grigsby suspects
something" "that you're going to Malice?"

Grigsby steps out of the shadows, "you're going to Malice, you say?
Mind if I come along?  I'd like to investigate the new boss out that
way."

Leah panics.  Dodge tells him to fuck off.  A brief negotiation later,
the three are on the road to Malice, Grigsby having handed over some
oddments in payment.  Dodge likes fast cars and fast music, and puts
the latter on, loudly.

*Meanwhile...*

Ruby is outside Apotheosis, near the entrance, doing some target
practice.  Next to her is a small, but growing, pile of small dead
animals.  A hairless and deformed fox scurries out of the undergrowth.
She splits its head open.  More meat.

A man approaches, walking down the Malice road.  He's kind of thin,
medium height, and wearing a thick yellow hooded cloak.  In the
distance behind him, clouds start to gather.  He stops a little short
of the entrance, looking between Ruby and the guards, and loudly asks
if he can have leave to enter.  Ruby ignores him.  One of the guards
goes to fetch Commander Zagan.

*Meanwhile...*

Commander Zagan is showing around a newly-arrived family, bragging
about all the fantastic amenities Apotheosis has: running water,
rationed spam, dry beds.  A veritable paradise.

The guard arrives, and whispers his errand in the commander's ear.
Zagan makes his apologies to the family, and sits them down to watch
an educational film about Apotheosis: bits of tape from pre-apocalypse
films spliced together, with new bits inserted showing old-style
silent film dialogue cards.

Zagan arrives at the gate.  He glances at Ruby and her pile of
corpses, but keeps most of his attention on the man.  They have a
brief conversation.  The man asks if he can come in to spread "the
word of chaos", but Zagan isn't having any of that.

The storm is growing, but Zagan pushes the man out.  As a gesture of
goodwill, he gives the man a hat to protect himself.  But no preaching
in Apotheosis today.

The man sets off back down the road.

*Later...*

Ruby arrives in the Rattlesnake, and wordlessly hands over her
still-dripping bag of fresh meat.  Dinnerlady, just as wordlessly,
hands her a crate of bottles of drink and tins of food.  This is an
exchange they've performed many times before.

*At Malice...*

Dodge's jeep pulls into the junkyard.  It's close to Malice, but the
piles of crap are so high you can hide behind them.  Everyone gets out
of the car.  Oi appears from somewhere, and scrambles up a junk
mountain to keep an eye out.

Leah and Dodge get to searching.  Grigsby just hangs around.

Atop her mountain, Oi spies three men in Malice, near the junkyard.
She opens her mind to the maelstrom trying to sense if any of them are
wolves, as she knows there is one in Malice.  To her shock, there is a
wolf: it's near Apotheosis, not Malice, but it's and getting closer.
Feels like it's on the road, a few hours walk away.  Oi scrambles down
and reports her findings: "we've got to go, it's not safe!  there's
three men, and a wolf!"

Grigsby isn't scared of any wolves, but he is interested in those men.
He slips away, and approaches them.

They stop when they see him.  He greets them, saying "you may have
heard me on the radio."

"The radio station from Apotheosis?" one says.

"Ah, a fan!  I have some questions about your new boss, if you don't
mind."

"Apotheosis?  I think the boss would like to meet you, but he's out
just now, should be back later" another man says.

"Oh, well, here's my card, it's got my private radio frequency."

"No, I think the boss would really like to meet you *in person*." the
same man says, stepping forward menacingly.

"Now just you hang on there, I'm not alone!"

Grigsby manages to bluff that he has some others with him, including
the famed sharpshooter Ruby Monsoon, and they're expecting him back.
The man relents, not wanting to get into a shooting match.  He takes
the card, and they watch him go.

When Grigsby gets back to the junkyard, Dodge and Ruby found a plane
engine and are loading it into the car.  He doesn't waste any time,
"let's go!"

The car speeds off out of the junkyard and back towards Apotheosis.
On the road, in the rain, they pass a man.  A thin medium-height man
wearing a thick yellow hooded cloak, with a hat on top of the hood.
As the car speeds past, he looks up, and makes eye contact with Oi.

*That evening...*

Zagan decides to make a pre-emptive strike against Malice, destroying
their armoury.  So he got Leah to make a bomb---an unstable thing made
out of a car engine, some plastic tubing, and a bunch of colourful
liquids; it even had a key to set it off---and set off in the jeep
with Dodge, Ruby, Balls, and Dog Head.

They parked out of sight, and snuck into the town.  People roamed the
streets, and guards stood outside the armoury.  The gang crept over to
an alley next to the building, and broke a window.  Turns out Oi came
with them too, and it's too late to send her back now.

Footsteps approaching.  Ruby hid at the entrance to the alley, and
quickly dragged in the guard to peered around.  She soundlessly slit
his throat and lowered the body to the ground.

Dodge decides to see if there was anything in the armoury she wanted
before they blew it up, so she hopped in through the window.  No
car-mounted guns, sadly, but there was a grenade launcher and a sack
of grenades.  Nice!

Oi opens her mind to the maelstrom again, trying to sense the wolf
from earlier.  She senses it alright: it's nearby, and it's suddenly
aware of her.  Like when Frodo puts the Ring on in Mount Doom and
shines like a beacon to Sauron.  She clambers through the window,
"it's not safe!", opens a door, and hides beneath a desk.  After a few
minutes, Zagan coaxes her out, saying that they're leaving now.

Everyone but Dog Head sneaks back out.  He leans through the window,
ignites the bomb, drops it, and sprints out without trying to be
stealthy.  A few seconds later the building erupts: windows and doors
blown out, people on the street knocked over.  He's blown over too,
but got far enough away that he can pick himself up and keep going.
Everyone piles into Dodge's jeep, which tears away down the road, with
no attempt at stealth.

Two other vehicles start pursuing: a massive keep with metal spikes
stuck all over it, and a sleek, vintage, convertible, with three
people crammed into two seats.  Dodge tries to slam the convertible
off the road, but misjudges the distance and stops short; it slams her
instead, tearing up the side and ripping off some of the armour
plating.

Just then, Leah arrives in the APC, bouncing over a rise, slamming
into the convertible and flinging it off the road.  Its side crumpled
in, and the passengers crumpled, too.  They're not moving any time
soon.

Dodge slows down and pulls up next to the APC.  Ruby jumps to the APC.
Leah jumps in surprise.

The spiky jeep slams its brakes on, and Dodge crashes into the back of
it; the windshield, lights, and bonnet perforated.  The people manage
to avoid the spikes though.

Ruby opens fire with the APC's machine gun, pinning down the men in
the jeep.

Zagan clambers out of the busted windshield, over the other vehicle,
shoots the driver, the passenger gets one shot off but it pings off
Zagan's armour; Zagan kills him too, climbs into the jeep, and drives
it back to Apotheosis.


Session 3
---------

Last time, Leah got her plane engine, Grigsby got away from some
malicious men, Dodge got a grenade launcher, Ruby got a crate of
alcohol, and Gustav got to blow up an armoury.  I think that's about
it.

The radio broadcast this time was just a bulleted list of updates:

- Leah got a new engine for some sort of project she's working on.
- Roark, mentioned in the first broadcast, was promoted to Captain of
  the Defence Force and was allowed to keep his child.
- Dremmer, hitherto unmentioned, the Captain of the Suppression Force,
  started trouble again---something about not getting enough
  respect---and in the ensuing fight was put in the infirmary.

*Flashback to Roark's promotion...*

After a private meeting in his office, Zagan took Roark out for the
public celebration of his promotion.  A big stage, a big handshake,
and the presentation of a medal.  Troops gave a gun salute.  Not all
the troops had matching equipment, and some of the medals were bottle
caps, but it was as grand as Zagan could make it.

*At Mistfield Farm...*

Leah arrived at the farm, with Dog Head driving, called out to fix a
busted generator.  Brother Grome is waiting for them.

"Grome again..." says Dog Head.  Leah asks what's up: he thinks
something's wrong.  Brother Grome always seems to be around, and
somehow shows up and interrupts every time you try to talk to anyone
else at the farm.  Very strange.

Brother Grome takes them to the generator shed, explaining about how
it stopped working, and leaves Leah and Dog Head to get on with it,
but says he'll be nearby if they need him.  The generator is broken,
but Leah can fix it with a couple of hours work.

Part way through, Dog Head says "watch this", and steps out of the
shed.  Immediately Brother Grome appears and asks if they need
anything.  "No, just stretching my legs."

Dog Head suggests you two split up so that one of you can talk to the
others here, and see what's going on.  Leah asks Brother Grome where
the toilets are, he starts to say "if you'll both follow me...",
before Dog Head interrupts saying he needs to watch the generator.
Leah concurs, the flange pump needs reticulating at just the right
moment, or they'll have to start again.  Brother Grome seems
uncertain, then calls over Sister Mary to show Leah where to go.

Leah tries to engage Sister Mary in conversation, but Sister Mary
doesn't talk.  She just looks at the ground as she guides Leah.  When
Leah brings up Brother Grome, she stumbles a bit, and trembles.  She's
terrified.

When she gets back Brother Grome, the usual friendliness in his eyes
replaced with suspicion, says that he saw them talking, and asks what
they talked about.  "Oh, just talking about the farm, it's a nice
community you've got here."  The friendliness returns, and they have a
chat about what the farmers actually believe in.  The way Brother
Grome explains it, they see work as morally good, as they're
fulfilling the purpose god gave them---just like how animals fulfil
their natural purpose---and that sloth is the ultimate sin.

Leah and Dog Head finish their work and leave, deciding not to
confront Brother Grome there and then.  More investigation is needed.

*Meanwhile, at The Rattlesnake...*

Dodge sits, half slumped over her table, and spies Miss Vine arrive.
Strange to see her here.  She carefully picks her way across the room,
stepping over the drunks, the bottles, and the occasional pool of
vomit, and arrives at Dodge's table.  She says she's come for Zagan's
coffee and then, unusually for her, hesitates briefly and says "you
can be discrete, right?"

Turns out that Burns, one of the old guys living in the shacks near
the dorms, needs a job doing.  There's a package at a drop site in the
middle of nowhere which he needs fetching.  Dodge reads between the
lines to see that it's probably not a set-up: Miss Vine trusts her to
get the job done and not talk about it.  They negotiate pay, and then
Dodge goes to see Burns.

Burns, an old balding guy with a large white moustache, explains
carefully where the package is.  He says normally his grandson would
go, but the grandson died in the last raid.  He pays up front, and
Dodge sets off.  She picks up Ruby on her way out.

The site is an old highway, the surrounding ground dotted with small
craters, and the road itself crowded with abandoned vehicles.  It's
quiet.  Burns explained exactly which car the package was in, so they
find it easily.  The package is a small, impressively locked, wooden
box.  The box itself has a lock, and is wrapped in multiple padlocked
chains.  Ruby shakes it, but it's so full (or so empty) that nothing
rattles, and she can't tell anything about the contents.

Just then, three bikers show up.

Dodge and Ruby scurry back to the jeep and set off.  The bikers come
in pursuit.

Ruby leans out of the jeep window aiming the grenade launcher, but the
biker in front is faster: he gets a shot off, she drops the grenade
launcher, and falls out of the jeep, rolling along the road.  Dodge
slams on the brakes, the biker is too close and gets taken out.  A
second biker stops next to the grenade launcher and reaches for it,
but Ruby gets him to back off.  She picks it up, and gets hit in the
back by the third biker, wielding a metal pole.  Dodge drives into the
group: the bikers jump out of the way, and Ruby climbs in.  They
escape.

Back in Apotheosis, Dodge delivers the box without asking what's
inside.

*That night...*

The mutant siren goes off: there's a raid.

Grigsby is woken up by the noise, and sees his bedroom door open.
There's a figure silhouetted there.  He asks "Leah, is that you?", but
there's no response.

Leah, also woken up by the siren, groggily stumbles out of her room
and into Grigsby's.  She brushes past the unknown figure before
realising that there's someone there, and stops dead.  As she replays
the last minute in her head, she thinks how hard and metallic the arm
she touched was...

Oi wakes up, but not because of the siren; she can sleep through worse
noise than that.  Oi wakes up because she senses a wolf.  But, when
she concentrates, she realises it's not *quite* a wolf.  It's inside
the radio shack, and she scurries down from her hiding place to
investigate.

Leah puts the light on.  The figure is a tall woman, her face covered
in piercings, and a mohawk.

Grigsby starts to tell Leah off for bringing her friends to the shack
without permission, before the woman interrupts: "so you really don't
remember me, after you abandoned me to save yourself!"

Grigsby wakes up fully, and remembers.  Before Apotheosis, she was in
their group: him, Zagan, Innkeeper, and a few others.  She got
romantically involved with a mutant, which Zagan took as a threat to
his authority; even then he was using the "mutants are monsters" story
to scare people into line.  It culminated in a fight: Grigsby had his
throat torn out, and Innkeeper was left got dead.  But now she's back.

Innkeeper raises her pistol, and shoots Grigsby.  Leah tries to
intervene, but is too slow.  Grigsby reels in pain, Leah shoots
Innkeeper in the head with her shotgun, and Innkeeper... isn't too
fazed.  Her face gets scratched, like painted metal someone's taken a
key to, and one of her eyes was blown out, revealing a glowing red
machine eye beneath.

Grigsby tazes her, but she shrugs it off.

Oi drops from a ventilation shaft in the ceiling onto Innkeeper's
head, and manages to ask "what are you?" before Innkeeper flings her
to the floor.

Noticing sparking inside the eye socket, Leah decides to try
short-circuiting Innkeeper.  She grabs Grigsby's chamberpot, flinging
it in Innkeeper's face.  Innkeeper collapses to the floor, unmoving.

Oi dives on her and starts trying to pry her face off with a knife.
After a few moments, it pops off.  A metal face which looks human, but
a robot beneath.

Nobody is really sure what's going on, but Grigsby suggests that maybe
Leah could get Innkeeper working again.  "Great, another secret."

*Meanwhile...*

Roark busts into Zagan's office / bedroom, bringing the news that 15
mutants are attacking.  They're almost inside the walls.  Zagan says
to call the men, and goes to his tank.

Several minutes later, Zagan arrives at the walls in his tank, the men
arriving too.  They already outnumber the mutants, who are climbing
over the fence.  The fight breaks out.  Most mutants are killed in the
initial exchange of bullets and shells, some making it inside
Apotheosis and scattering.  Soon they're all dead, or have fled.

Zagan sends some men to follow the fleeing mutants back to their camp.
One comes back after an hour and says that there's a new camp on the
far side of a nearby hill.

Apotheosis forces set out.  The strategy is to surround the enemy:
send the foot-soldiers out behind the mutant camp, and have the
vehicles attack from the front.  Most of the mutants will run from the
firepower, and into the waiting ambush.

Battle vehicles crest the hill, and start blasting the camp.  Some of
the mutants fight back, and die.  Most run, into the waiting men, and
die.  It's a massacre.  The men laugh as they kill.

After examining the camp for supplies, it's set on fire.  The men hang
around warming themselves with the flames, talking and joking, until
it's just ash.

*The next day...*

Grigsby approaches Zagan suggesting a peace deal with Malice.  Zagan's
open to the idea, and Grigsby quickly gets the leader of Malice on the
line.

It's a voice Zagan recognises.  The voice of the man who visited
Apotheosis asking to come in to preach about chaos.  The man who Oi
sensed to be a wolf.  Sandalphon.

Zagan starts by mocking Sandalphon about blowing up their armoury:
"how do you like chaos now?"  But he's is incredibly infazed, and just
says that they can rebuild when they need to.

A deal is hammered out.  Zagan wants a superior position, but doesn't
really get it.  Sandalphon wants an open borders agreement, but
doesn't really get it.  They settle on a ceasefire---no raids---and
access for trade caravans.
