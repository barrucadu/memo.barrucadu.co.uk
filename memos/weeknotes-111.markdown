## Work

Due to some scheduling confusion, I only went on support this week for
one day, rather than a full week, so I had unexpectedly more time to
spend on team things, which was nice.

It was another busy week, but I'm hoping things will start to slow
down a bit from now.  I'm wondering about running a retro just for us
devs to talk about how our development processes are working out for
us and what we need to change.  I feel that I'm often doing a lot of
the more complex bits of work, so I want to get to the bottom of that:
am I breaking up work badly, is it that other people feel they can't
get things done as quickly as me (and is that a problem?), or is there
some other issue?


## The Plague

It seems we're entering another month-long lockdown.  Ah well, I've
been living the same way since the first one.


## Books

This week I read:

- [Inversions][] by Iain M. Banks, the sixth of the [Culture series][].

  This was a nice twist on the usual Culture format.  It read more
  like a low-fantasy book, as it's told from the perspective of a
  native of a generic-medieval world which was visited by some Culture
  agents from Special Circumstances.  So we get tales of the doctor's
  miraculous medicines and strange practices (and also I don't think
  it can be a coincidence that the benevolent interfering alien is a
  doctor) , and then zoom out at the end and see how things have
  changed, for the better, over the years thanks to this interference.

## Games

This week my Masks of Nyarlathotep campaign continued to diverge from
my last one.  The players have fixated on Australia being *absolutely
central* to what's going on, whereas my previous group skipped over
Australia entirely!  I'm looking forward to it, as I've only skimmed
the Australia chapter; it'll be nice to run a new (to me) part of the
story.

I also agreed to run a Pulp Cthulhu one-shot for my other group, as we
decided to postpone out usual game (Wolves of God) until January.  So
I'll need to figure something out for that.


## Miscellaneous

I wrote a memo on [my home network set-up][], now that it's all
working.  It took more time and effort than expected, but I am very
happy with the end result.  The UniFi network management stuff is very
easy to use, and I now get usable wifi in my bedroom, which is the
furthest away point in my flat from the access point.

I'm already thinking about the next upgrades; but those can wait...

This week [NixOS 20.09][] was released, so [I upgraded all my
machines][].  This was pretty smooth, other than needing to rewrite my
[Caddy][] configs for Caddy 2.  Weirdly, I also lost 256-colour
support in [PuTTY][], and had to upgrade PuTTY to fix it---perhaps a
change to the terminfo in NixOS 20.09?
