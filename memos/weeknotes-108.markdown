## Work

This week we continued working towards our first live experiment for
[GOV.UK Accounts][].  Most of the backend work is done or in review
(just one feature to go), and the frontend is progressing.  Things are
a bit behind where I'd hoped they would be, I think I need to get
better at planning (and communicating those plans) so that if I'm off
for a week the work keeps moving smoothly.

## Books

This week I read:

- [Consider Phlebas][] by Iain M. Banks, the first of the [Culture series][].
- [The Player of Games][] by Iain M. Banks, the second of the [Culture series][].

  I'd read both of these before, many years ago, but I've not read all
  of the Culture books, so I decided to go through the series from the
  beginning.  They're good, definitely easier to read than Malazan,
  and entertaining.  I'm not sure I'd go so far as to say that these
  are "the standard by which modern sci-fi is judged" (as one of the
  book reviews says), but definitely good stuff.

## Network rebuild

I am cursed to always be a couple of components away from being done.
As the cables I needed were still a little while away, I decided to
upgrade to a Ubiquiti router, switch, and access point, which would
arrive in time.

The cables arrived on Tuesday.

The switch arrived on Wednesday.

The router and access point... have been lost by UPS.

The latest tracking update for that package is "In Transit" from
Tuesday.  On Friday I got in touch with the local UPS depot, who
couldn't find the package in their warehouse.  They told me to contact
the sender "who will hopefully send you a replacement" while UPS
search for the package.  Great.
