Pitch
-----

### Welcome, Travellers!

*Theme song: [The Lord Weird Slough Feg - Traveller - High Passage / Low Passage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiHpfugCboI)*

You are Travellers, the rag-tag crew of a scrappy little ship, up to
your eyeballs in debt.  You don't have much, but it's something.

You make a living flitting around the sector transporting cargo and
passengers, trying to beat the interstellar market with speculative
trading, and doing odd jobs for whoever will pay---sometimes legal,
sometimes not.

#### Setting

We'll use the Official Traveller Universe, specifically starting in
the [Trojan Reach sector][] (see also its [Traveller Wiki entry][] and
[Traveller Map booklet][]), probably the Sindal subsector.

I think this is a fun sector to play in because it's got a good mix of powers:

- 45% [Third Imperium][], the major human empire
- 34% [Aslan Hierate][], one of the major alien races
- 8% [Florian League][], a smaller human state
- and the rest is small [pocket empires][] or unaligned worlds

So there's lots of opportunity for tension, conflicts, and crime.

You could possibly move into one of the adjacent sectors, but a sector
is *big*.  A subsector is 10x8 hexes, and a sector is 4x4 subsectors,
so crossing a sector top-to-bottom would take 40 weeks with a Jump-1
engine, 20 weeks with a Jump-2 engine, etc, plus any time needed for
maintenance and refuelling.  Even the fastest ships, the Imperium's
X-Boats with their Jump-6 engines, would take 7 weeks to cross a full
sector.

I'll make some effort to stick to the published setting, but will make
stuff up or change things when I need to, and I won't worry about
being totally consistent.  One change I'm making is **no psionics**. I
don't like them.  Go play a fantasy game if you want magic.  There
might be mind-reading technology, but it'll be a device you have to
put your head in, not someone thinking at you.

#### Party

I'd prefer for this to be a majority-human campaign: you can have
*one* alien PC if you want, but since most of the planets in the
region are human, they'll stand out a bit (and possibly be assumed to
be spies).

The two most suitable alien races would be Aslan (lion people) or
Vargr (wolf people).

I want aliens to feel alien, so here are some constraints:

- If you're a human raised in the Third Imperium you have a basic
  knowledge of the alien cultures, but probably not much detail.
- If you're an Aslan or a Vargr raised in the Third Imperium you have
  a good understanding of and tolerance for human culture.  You also
  have a good understanding of your traditional culture, but it
  doesn't necessarily influence your behaviour (e.g., an Aslan raised
  in the Third Imperium is unlikely to challenge a human to a formal
  duel over a matter of honour, unless raised in a very traditional
  family).
- If you're an Aslan or a Vargr raised in your traditional culture, it
  influences your behaviour a lot.  You have a basic understanding of
  human culture and have some tolerance for humans acting in the wrong
  way (to your eyes).

Regardless of your species, there'll be opportunities to get involved
with intrigue and politics in all of the cultures in the Trojan Reach.
Though, Aslan politics is likely to come up more frequently with an
Aslan from the Aslan Hierate in your crew.

A ship will generally need:

- a captain
- a pilot
- an astrogator
- an engineer
- a sensor operator
- a medic

You might also want:

- a steward, if you plan to take paying passengers
- a gunner, if you have ship weapons
- a marine, if you'll be getting into fights

These don't all need to be separate people, not every ship needs each
of these positions filled, and you can hire NPCs to fill any gaps;
except in space combat where you need a separate pilot and captain,
and have to have both of them, and is it any fun if an *NPC* is the
captain?

#### Campaign style

At least to start with, this is going to be a pretty episodic job- or
planet-of-the-week style game, where you're doing whatever job you can
get.  For inspiration, think *Firefly*.

I plan to have a mix of genres: maybe one session it'll be horror as
you investigate a distress signal from an isolated research station;
and the next session could be a heist, with you doing some job for a
local crime boss; and the session after that might be a mystery, as
you try to clear your names of a crime you've been framed for by
finding out what really happened.

Once we've done a few of these games and you know what sort of game
you want, we'll specialise:

##### The Traveller Campaign

We can just carry on as we have been, with you doing a little bit of
everything: exploring ancient alien ruins in one session, and punching
crime bosses or running from government agents in the next.

See the random mission and encounter tables in the rulebook for ideas
of what you might get up to.

##### The Career Campaign

We'll focus the campaign around one or more of the careers used in
character creation.  You don't all need to have done that career, as
any organisation will have staff in a variety of roles.  For example:

- **Agent Campaign:** we'll focus on espionage, counterespionage,
  assassination, and investigation; likely to have a lot of stealth.
- **Colonist Campaign:** we'll focus on setting up new colonies and
  making them self-sustaining; likely to have more of a soap-opera
  feel.
- **Marine / Navy Campaign:** we'll focus on war, crime, and piracy;
  likely to have a lot of combat.
- **Scholar / Scout Campaign:** we'll focus on exploration, alien
  artefacts, and the unknown; likely to have a lot of macguffins.

There are lots of other careers, this list isn't exhaustive.

##### The Space Pirate Campaign

Mundane jobs don't have the thrill you're looking for, you want to do
crimes.  Space crimes.  And what's the most fun sort of space crime?
Space piracy.

A space pirate campaign will focus on smuggling, blockade running,
ship-to-ship combat, dealing with crime lords, and actually a lot of
the sort of stuff you'd get up to in a Traveller Campaign, just more
illegal.

There are two ways we could flavour this:

- You arrange for a crime lord to buy out your mortgage.  You're free
  men!  Well, except for the favours he expects from you,
  indefinitely.

- You join with one of the small states dreaming of having a glorious
  interstellar empire as a privateer.  You're issued with a [letter of
  marque][] and have a safe home base, so long as you regularly commit
  acts of piracy against the enemies of the state.

Being a pirate doesn't mean you're always on the run from law
enforcement and can never interact with non-criminals.  If you adopt
fake names and identification then you'll be able to pass as
law-abiding citizens when needed, and so do other jobs too.  But be
careful nobody finds out your true identity!

Capes and dramatic gestures are mandatory.  Space pirates are
larger-than-life.

[letter of marque]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letter_of_marque

### Long-term goals

While I am planning to run a fairly episodic game, there is definitely
scope for long-term plotlines and character goals.

For example, you could:

- hire other ships and crews to work for you, forming a mercantile (or
  criminal) empire
- overthrow your patron and take over their organisation and
  underlings, becoming the new boss
- create a base of operations by hollowing out and building in an
  asteroid, or setting up your own space station
- be elevated to the nobility

You don't have to commit to a long-term goal from the start of the
campaign, but think about it.  When we specialise on a campaign style,
it'd be a shame if *nobody* had any long-term goals.

#### Rules

In addition to these rule changes listed below, I'll draw upon things
from other sourcebooks which aren't rule *changes* as such, but more
rule *elaborations*, which go into more detail for how to deal with a
specific situation: like starvation, hazardous terrain, laying and
dealing with space mines, hiding inside the atmosphere of a gas giant,
or ship transponders.  These are all situational so I'll use my
judgement to decide when they apply.

We might also bring in some rules later in the campaign, for example
if someone decides they want to become a noble, we might bring in the
**Effective SOC** rules from page 9 of the *Traveller Companion*.  We
can talk about those at the time.

##### Rules we are going to use

I'm not interested in running a campaign where these aren't the case.

- **Human Focus.**  There can be at most one non-human PC, and they
  must be Aslan or Vargr.

- **No Psionics.**  There is no psionics in this universe.  At all.
  Neither PC nor NPC.

##### Rules I think we should use

I could be persuaded not to use these, but I think they would improve
the game.

- **Alien Upbringing** (*Aliens of Charted Space: Volume 1*).  An
  alien PC may be created using the standard rules, in which case they
  were born and raised in the Third Imperium, or created using the
  species-specific rules.

- **Allies, Contacts, Rivals, and Enemies** (*Traveller Companion*
  chapter 3).  We'll flesh out NPCs introduced in character creation
  with Affinity, Enmity, Power, Influence, and Special
  Characteristics.

- **Boon Dice.** In character creation, for two characteristics of
  your choice, roll `3d6` and discard the lowest.

##### Rules we might want

Here are some rules which I think would be fun, but let's talk about
them.

- **Additional Wound Effects** (*Traveller Companion* page 49).
  Rather than being killed outright when all their physical
  characteristics are reduced to 0, Travellers and important NPCs make
  a roll modified by the circumstances of the injury to determine
  whether they die, suffer some crippling injury, or miraculously
  survive.

- **Luck** (*Traveller Companion* page 4).  A new characteristic which
  can be used to do better on skill checks.

- **Misjumps** (*Traveller Companion* page 143).  The standard rules
  for misjumps are pretty boring, let's use the variant rules.  This
  does mean that a really bad misjump could destroy the ship instantly
  or send you 36 parsecs in the wrong direction.

Rumours
-------

1. *No rumour, roll a random encounter!*

2. *Roll a random Patron / Mission / Target.*

3. *Roll a random Patron / Mission / Target.*

4. There's a guy called Omicron, or maybe an organisation, who make
   exceptional custom weapons.  There's a certain safety deposit box
   at the Tobia highport, if you leave some money and a description of
   what you want, they'll either make it for you or give you your
   money back.  But it sometimes takes months.

5. Miners on Argona say there’s a giant crystal covered in intricate
   carvings somewhere in the glacier-tunnels, but everyone who’s seen
   it has died or gone mad.

6. **Lions of Thebus:** Lord Ftahkaiw was recently in the area, he
   caused a big commotion, showered people with money, and eventually
   left to oversee business elsewhere.

7. ?

8. ?

9. Someone on Sperle is trying to set up a smuggling route to get past
   the GeDeCo-owned shipping lanes.

10. Umemii wants more trade ships to stop off there, but all the
    traffic in the region goes through the better-equipped ports at
    Tanith, Acrid, or Cordan instead.

11. ?

12. ?

13. Apparently some large corporation has been pushing for the
    Imperium to remove the red travel zone restriction on Vume, and is
    interested in how exactly that restriction came about.

14. The government of Paal is paying above-market rates for high-tech
    goods.

15. ?

16. Thalassa has, once again, rejected Torpol's request for genetic
    material from their floating plant-cities, which the Provosts of
    Torpol want to replicate.  Unofficially, Torpol would pay a lot
    for seeds and information, and even more for the famous Thalassan
    geneticist Dr. Thorkan.

17. There's a mad scientist on Exocet who thinks he can shut down the
    planet's volcanoes, making the terraforming go much faster, with
    high-yield atomic bombs.  Which are incredibly illegal in all
    civilised space.

### Known

- The Hierate has taken the Glorious Empire worlds of Keawoaw and Alr.

- There have been protests by the human population of Hradus against
  the Imperium's technology restrictions, claiming that the Aslan
  population have proven themselves honourable and trustworthy time
  and time again over the centuries.  The Aslan themselves have not
  become involved.

- A noble son in his yacht went missing on the way to Vume, Cr100,000
  reward for information, Cr200,000 for finding and returning it.

- The royal house of the Sindalian Empire never went extinct.  The
  current Emperor of Sindal and Protector of the Reach still lives on
  the old capital world of Noricum and gives the Imperial Blessing of
  the Star Dragon to all who perform a service for him.

- A new archaeological site has been found at Vume, it seems to be
  some sort of Ancient factory.

- Sea monsters killed all the humans on 971-852.

- **Pirates of Drinax:** The king of Drinax is plotting revenge
  against the Aslan for destroying the kingdom two centuries ago.

- Most of Noricum is uninhabitable, due to the bioweapons which felled
  the empire.

- There's been an unusual number of misjumps along the Sindalian Main
  in the last few months.

- Zhodani scout ships have been seen in the sector in recent months.
  Why are they here?  They have no colonies or starports.

- There's an old woman who runs the starport bar on Falcon who knows
  more about freighter schedules than anyone else.

- Every ship from the Tobia Commerce Guild carries at least six
  trained marines on board to repel pirates.

- **Captain Envai's Cavern:** 200 years ago, a ship stumbled upon an
  old cache of Sindalian tech while on the run from another three
  ships.  With the new equipment, they crushed their pursuers and
  spent the rest of their days pillaging trade routes.  Nobody knows
  where that cache was or what else could be in there.

- There's been a discovery of new and very valuable ore deposits on
  Number One, but for some reason they're not entering the local
  markets.

- **Revolution on Acrid:** PRQ are sending in union-busters, output
  has fallen, someone needs a shipment of pro-worker leaflets
  delivering, the Workers' Revolution needs weapons, etc.

- The Psychopomps of Clarke seem to consider Prince Harrick of Drinax
  a figure of religious significance, and keep petitioning him for a
  state visit.

- **Shadows of Sindal:** Prince Richter Grehai claims to be the
  legitimate heir to the Sindalian throne, the Grehai Movement is a
  gathering of well-meaning but not-very-competent followers who aim
  to deter Aslan expansion into the Trojan Reach.

- A hidden enclave of the Cult of the Traveller was found recently on
  Byrni.  The security forces tried to take them into custody, but the
  cultists turned it into a bloodbath.  Apparently they laugh and sing
  as they kill...

House rules
-----------

### Passengers & Freight

The costs in the "Passenger and Freight Costs" table on page 207 are
for a single jump, not a full route.

If you want to get passengers and freight to cover a multi-jump route,
each the number of jumps after the first is a negative DM on the
traffic roll.

### Healing

An injured Traveller who does not seek medical treatment or bed rest
must, at the end of every day, roll `1D + END DM`:

- On a 0 or higher, nothing happens.
- On a -1 or lower, they lose that many characteristic points.

Furthermore, if the Traveller has a characteristic at 0 points, they
are too injured to do anything but rest.

### Htoua

<img src="campaign-notes-2021-10-traveller/htoua.jpg" width="256" style="float: right">

Htoua is an Aslan game similar to shogi.

The pieces are named after Aslan clan roles, thus, you have to defeat
the Clan Head, who is protected by his Clan Lords, Pride Heads, Family
Heads, First Sons, and Second Sons.  It's played over three phases,
with each having slightly different allowable moves.  When a piece is
lost, the player immediately chooses one from the next rank down to
promote to their place (and then so on to replace the promoted piece).
Captured pieces can be brought back into play as Second Sons.

The game ends when the Clan Head has been captured.

1. In secret, both sides choose a playstyle:
   - **Aggressive:** both sides get a boon on the final opposed check
   - **Defensive:** both sides get a bane on the final opposed check
   - **Neutral:** no additional effect
2. In secret, both sides choose a strategy:
   - **Misdirection:**
     - Attempt to pull your opponent's defences in one direction, so
       you can attack from the other.
     - **Skill:** Int / Deception
     - **Bonus:** +2 against a defensive playstyle
   - **Entrapment:**
     - Attempt to lure your opponent's attacking pieces into a trap,
       so you can capture them.
     - **Skill:** Int / Persuade
     - **Bonus:** +2 against an aggressive playstyle
   - **Overwhelming force:**
     - Attempt to overwhelm your opponent quickly, before they can
       develop their strategy.
     - **Skill:** Int / Tactics
     - **Bonus:** +2 against a neutral playstyle
   - **Luck:**
     - Use your innate knowledge of games to improvise a strategy as
       you go.
     - **Skill:** Int / Gambler
     - **Bonus:** +1
3. Both sides try to guess the opponent's strategy, and then start a
   task chain by making the relevant skill check (with +2 for guessing
   correctly).
4. Make an opposed Int / Htoua check (or Edu / Htoua, if drawing upon
   the study of past games), with the appropriate strategy bonus and
   task chain bonus.

2021-10-10 --- Session 0
------------------------

> Welcome to session zero of Traveller!  Today we'll talk a bit about
> the sort of campaign we want to play, and then dive into character
> creation.  The actual game will begin next session.  I've written a
> campaign pitch, which I think you've all read, but we'll cover all
> the points in it, and some more, now.  We might overrun today, as
> character creation can take a while.

### Prep

#### Pitch

- Sandbox, with scope for long-term goals
- Official Traveller Universe, starting in the Trojan Reach sector
  (Tobia subsector, not Sindal)
- I'll make some effort to stick to the published setting, but won't
  necessarily be totally consistent
- No psionics
- Majority human party (or one species), one alien PC (Aslan or Vargr)
  if you want

#### Alien Travellers

##### Aslan

- Alien lion warrior race
- Live into their 60s
- Bigger than humans on average (average male is 2m tall, weighs
  100kg)
- Sleep for about a third of every 32-hour period
- Almost exclusively carnivorous, preferring freshly-slaughtered prey
- Can't digest Earth-derived meats without special pills (or permanent
  treatment)
- Social structure: families form prides (ahriy), which form clans,
  who may owe fealty to more powerful clans
- Spiritual but not religious, most Aslan carry some keepsakes or
  heirlooms, and obey the traditions of their ancestors
- Very proud and honourable, with formal duels in response to insults
- Careers and skills are gender-segregated: females go for more
  intellectual or educated careers, males go for more combat or
  diplomatic roles
- Males have little understanding of money and find it hard to grasp,
  as finances are a female affair

##### Vargr

- Genetically-engineered Earth wolf people created by the mysterious
  Ancients (and they're very proud of this)
- Live into their 70s
- Smaller than humans on average (average male is 1.6m tall, weighs
  60kg)
- Sleep several times in a 26-hour period
- Mostly carnivorous, also eat fruit
- Social structure: group / pack based, with most Vargr being in
  multiple packs, lead by charismatic leaders; Vargr are loyal to the
  pack, but seek to compete to improve their own charisma and standing
  in it
- Most Vargr are not especially religious, but they do venerate the
  Ancients.  Organised religions are just another pack.
- Where charisma alone cannot determine dominance, they will duel: the
  motivation is different to Aslan (charisma & loyalty vs honour &
  pride).
- Packs with charismatic leaders fall down over a certain scale, so
  Vargr do not have megacorporations or an interstellar government.
  They do have a lot of corsairs, lead by charismatic pirate-captains
  though.
- Vargr eyesight is less colour sensitive than humans so, to human
  eyes, all their clothes, art, and decorations are bright and garish

#### Discussion

##### Scheduling

- Session time & frequency
- What happens if someone can't make a session?
- Campaign length

##### Characters

- Changing characters / characters leaving the party
- Character death
- PvP (PvP isn't necessarily combat)
- Character secrets vs player secrets

##### Rules

- I expect you to know how your character works
- I have made cheatsheets for common rules
- Some parts of the game I will off-load entirely to you (eg, trade)
- Alternative rules:
  - No psionics
  - Character creation:
    - Alternative character creation rules for alien PCs raised in their
      native cultures
    - Luck (*Traveller Companion* page 4)
    - Boon Dice (*Traveller Companion* page 11)
    - Allies, Contacts, Rivals, and Enemies (*Traveller Companion*
      chapter 3)
  - Mechanics:
    - Additional Wound Effects (*Traveller Companion* page 49)
    - Misjumps (*Traveller Companion* page 143)
    - + whatever situational rules I think should apply
  - Was going to use exp point rule, but training is fine actually

##### Metagaming

- Reduction of "planning in-character actions out-of-character, when
  there's no opportunity in-character to do so" (discussing combat
  strategy in the middle of a round, or talking about what to say to
  an NPC when they're right next to you, or sharing information when
  the characters are not together --- rules questions, clarifying
  character knowledge, etc, are all fine)

### Notes

- Schedule: 3 hours fortnightly is ok
- Player absences: handle case-by-case
- Campaign length: no preference
- PvP: handle case-by-case (eg, combat is fine if both players agree
  to it at the time)
- Secrets: no preference
- Wounds: try it out, maybe revisit later
- Misjumps: ok
- Metagaming: we'll try to police it

#### To-do (players)

- Spend up to Cr2000 (out of your own money) on whatever you want.
- Make decisions for benefits:
  - **Weapon:** get a free weapon weapon with a limit of TL12 and
    Cr1000.
  - **Armour:** get a free piece of armour with a limit of TL12 and
    Cr10,000.
  - **Free Trader:** pick whether it's a Free Trader (Type-A) (*High
    Guard* p120) or Far Trader (Type-A2) (*High Guard* p118)

#### To-do (me)

- Review character sheets
- Review NPCs
- Figure out the initial location & mission
- Create story seeds for future endeavours
- Figure out how a campaign with two ships will work

### Next time

- Both captains receiving their ships
- Some sort of introductory adventure


2021-10-17 --- Week 0, Tobia
----------------------------

### Prep

#### Receiving the ships

- **Scout Ship:**
  - Tors Mallier, a Scout captain slouching back in his chair in a
    messy office in the naval base, hands over the key fob and
    explains the quirks.
  - He jokes about how up-tight the Navy are compared to the Scouts.
  - "Say hi to any other Scouts on Detached Duty you see out there.
    Some of them haven't come back to a base in years, but we still
    think about them."
  - Give missions.

- **Far Trader:**
  - Claire Waynhim, a bureaucrat from the GeDeCo Bank, hands over
    several key fobs in a busy hangar next to the ship.
  - She explains the mortgage and running costs, where the mortgage
    can be paid, the transponder, and to arrange beforehand if needing
    to delay payments.
  - Politely inquires what Astraea's plans are, and says that GeDeCo
    has a small task that needs doing right now, and may be able to
    offer more work in the future.

### Notes

- **Tobia:**
  - Take the Scout mission
  - Take the GeDeCo mission
  - Get a leaflet for the Church of Starry Wisdom
- **New:**
  - Complete the Scout mission
  - Blow up an asteroid for the Scouts
- **Imisaa:**
  - Learn rumours:
    - The Emperor of Sindal still lives on Noricum
    - There's unrest on Hradus
    - The Hierate have conquered Alr and Keawoar
  - Find new jobs:
    - Ktuarlaiaoaei (male) and Hwawyouayu (female) (those are the
      simplified-for-humans names) to Vume
    - A noble son in his yacht went missing on the way to Vume,
      Cr100,000 reward for information, Cr200,000 for finding and
      returning it
- **971-852:**
  - Calm down one of the scientists who was panicking about giant sea
    monsters
  - Drop them off for their month-long research expedition
- Pay mortgage and maintenance

### Next time

- Come up with more faction missions, random missions, and rumours
- Figure out how to pronounce Aslan names
- At Hradus
- Deal with freight and mail
- A few small jobs in the local area, as they need to return the
  scientists in a month


2021-10-29 --- Week 6, Hradus
-----------------------------

### State

- Ktuarl.ai.a.o.a.ei (M) and Hwaw.yo.u.a.yu (F), Aslan archaeologists
  who have paid Cr500,000 to go to Vume.

- Htu.i.ea.a (M), very minor Aslan noble (an ekhoko) going to Hradus
  to try to encourage some distant relations to return to the Hierate.

- Freight to Hradus

- Mail to Hradus

### Prep

#### Hradus

- Small, a little under half the surface area of Earth, but a similar
  population
- Almost all the surface area is habitable due to terraforming
  (kusyuforming), so there's lots of wilderness, and settlements are
  very spread out with a lot of integrated nature.  Light rail systems
  link together the distant parts of the cities.  Buildings are
  curved, unique, and well spaced out.  Natural lighting is preferred.
  Herds of aua wander the garssy "streets".  In the wilderness, khekha
  and stii can be found.
- Use of Boundary Boxes is encouraged, though the Aslan here are quite
  tolerant.
- Government is impersonal, bureaucratic, oppressive, controlling:
  - Appointed by the Imperium, due to special status
  - TL7+ items, weapons, armour, and drugs are all prohibited
- Political unrest over the treatment of the Aslan:
  - Human factions, some more militant than others
  - Aslan not getting involved, only one or two disgruntled outcasts
    participating
  - Players should see the mistreatment of the protestors and the
    disdain of the government
  - **job:** help the protestors (raid kusyuforming plant)
  - **job:** help the government deal with the protestors (infiltrate
  - **job:** GeDeCo would like the TL restrictions on Hradus to be
    lifted, and think helping the protestors is the most efficient way
    the rebels who plan to raid the kusyuforming plant)

##### The Rebels

- Ghoul (6H0UL), human male:
  - **STR** 7 **DEX** 8 **END** 6 **INT** 7 **EDU** 7 **SOC** 5
  - **Melee** 0 **Gun Combat** 1
  - Armed with **Stunner** (Range 5, Damage 2D+3, Stun)
  - Armed with **Laser Pistol** (Range 20, Damage 3D)
- Memento (M3M3N70), human female:
  - **STR** 7 **DEX** 8 **END** 6 **INT** 9 **EDU** 7 **SOC** 5
  - **Melee** 0 **Gun Combat** 0 **Electronics (Computers)** 2
  - Armed with **Stunner** (Range 5, Damage 2D+3, Stun)
- Sphinx (5PH1NX), aslan male:
  - **STR** 12 **DEX** 8 **END** 11 **INT** 9 **EDU** 6 **SOC** 6
  - **Gun Combat** 1 **Melee** 2
  - Armed with **Laser Pistol** (Range 20, Damage 3D)
  - Armed with **Dewclaw** (Damage 1D+2)
- These are all edgy hacker types

##### Kusyuforming Plant

- Geomorphs V06, 110, 114, 145, 146
- Surroundings heavily forested, with a clear area immediately around
  the plant
- A tall white square building, with some big steaming pipes sticking
  out of the walls, two on each side, about three quarters of the way
  up the building.  On one side is a rectangular shaft which looks
  like it could be a stairwell or for elevators.
- 4 kind of bored human guards outside, 2 inside:
  - **STR** 7 **DEX** 8 **END** 6 **INT** 7 **EDU** 7 **SOC** 5
  - **Gun Combat** 1 **Melee** 1
  - Armed with **Assault Rifle** (Range 200, Damage 3D, Auto 2)
- Hacking the plant is INT / Electronics (Computers) taking 1D*10
  minutes:
  - Difficult to immediately shut it off or otherwise change its
    operation in some big way
  - Very Difficult to subtly change its operation, or to put a delay
    on an obvious change, allowing escape before detection
- Undoing a hack is an opposed roll with the hacker

#### 971-852

- Scientists have captured an amphibious xenomorph.
- The only clue is two of the scientists struggling with a bulky case
  of equipment, which they didn't have so much trouble with when they
  arrived (because it wasn't full of water and monster then), and
  which they will prevent the Travellers from helping with.
- It will escape during the jump.
- Xenomorph:
  - **Hits** 12 **Armour** 3 **Speed** 12m
  - **Stealth** 2 **Melee (natural)** 1
  - **Bite** 3D
  - Acid Blood

### Notes

- **Hradus:**
  - Freight, deal with Htu.i.ea.a, refuel
  - Scout Ship maintenance
- **Jump Hradus to Saurus**
- **Saurus:**
  - Far Trader mortgage and maintenance
- **Jump Saurus to 971-852**
- **971-852**
  - Scientists have an unusually heavy crate, hmm...
- **Jump 971-852 to Pichot:**
  - Xenomorph escapes!  Hurts Astraea, Lynette kills it.
- **Pichot:**
  - Pirate attack!  Black Jack's Patrol Corvette!
  - Scout Ship: 29 HP, Cargo 1, M-Drive 1
  - Far Trader: 61 HP, Cargo 1, Fuel 1

### Next time

- Week 11
- Time-skip to Vume (deal with freight & passengers & repairs between sessions)


2021-11-28 --- Week 8, Tobia
----------------------------

### State

- Ktuarl.ai.a.o.a.ei (M) and Hwaw.yo.u.a.yu (F), Aslan archaeologists
  who have paid Cr500,000 to go to Vume.
  - **Ktuarl.ai.a.o.a.ei**: STR 12 (+2) DEX 8 (0) END 11 (+1) INT 9 (+1) EDU 6 (0)
    - Crescent Blade: damage 2D+3; skill 1
  - **Hwaw.yo.u.a.yu**: STR 7 (0) DEX 7 (0) END 8 (0) INT 10 (+1) EDU 7 (0)
    - Stunner: damage 2D; skill 1
  - Vacc Suit: armour +6, 50 rads
  - Dewclaw: 1D+2 damage; skill 2

- Far Trader damage:
  - **Hull Points:** 61 / 80
  - **Critical Hits:** Fuel 1

- Scout / Courier damage:
  - **Hull Points:** 29 / 40
  - **Critical Hits:** M-Drive 1

- Scientist job:
  - 125,000 Cr
  - 93,750 Cr hazard pay
  - = 218 750 cr

### Prep

#### Rules

- Injury house rule

- Lynette's flamethrower: swap to range 10 / blast 3, or a different
  weapon, or keep it (and hit self).

- Spare parts overspend:
  - I think I misread the spare parts price as 1,000,000 Cr (supposed
    to be 100,000 Cr).
  - Retroactively buy more spare parts at the cheap price that
    merchant was offering (50,000 Cr/ton), up to another 450,000 Cr
    worth; or just add 450,000 Cr to the party finances.

#### Bookkeeping

- Spend spare parts to repair the ships.
  - They have to at least repair the Fuel critical hit before they can
    jump to Tobia.
  - Assuming Astraea rests, she heals in the couple of weeks it takes
    to patch up their ships and jump to Tobia.
  - Shipyard maintenance will cost 80,000 Cr and 4 hours per ton of
    spare parts needed.

- It's mortgage and maintenance time again.

- Give Far Trader to the bank:
  - Monthly fee of 50,000 Cr + 15% of profit; 460,177.56 Cr left for you per trip.
  - Every 60 days (2 months; 8.5 weeks) trade income will be deposited
    in their bank account on Tobia (there's no FTL comms, so where the
    money is is very important!).
  - Income won't be consistent, I'll work out some sort of roll to
    determine if a trip is unusually good or bad.

- Route to Vume
  - Those without Vacc Suits may want to get one.

#### Travel to Vume

- Roll **once** for interesting events during the journey:
  - Make a jump check: if misjump, roll to see which jump it was.
  - Make a "a week in jumpspace" roll: if something happens, roll to
    see which jump it was.
  - Make a space encounter roll: if something happens, roll to see
    which system it was in.
  - Make a rumour check, with a bonus die if the PC is trying in
    multiple stops.
  - Character interactions:
    - Make Astraea and one of Ktuarl.ai.a.o.a.ei or Hwaw.yo.u.a.yu
      interact (try for Htoua)
    - For others, roll:
      - Orcan
      - Lynette
      - Ilijah
      - Xavier
      - The other of Ktuarl.ai.a.o.a.ei and Hwaw.yo.u.a.yu

- At the stop before Vume (likely Chalchiutlicue), they get the "no
  recent news from Vume" rumour

- Check for completed study periods.

#### Vume

- **On approach:**
  - On the bridge, alarms blare and all the screens display "EMERGENCY
    / QUARANTINE" in flashing bold red letters.  If an NPC is on duty,
    they run to get Ilijah.
  - Difficult Sensors check will pick up a lab ship dangerously close
    to the star.
  - If the players decide to immediately leave, Ktuarl.ai.a.o.a.ei
    reminds them that there's supposed to be about 20,000 people
    living on Vume --- it would be dishonourable and cowardly to leave
    without providing what emergency assistance we can.  If they
    press, more to the point, he'll want his money back.

- **Externally visible:**
  - A planet-covering network of roughly circular semi-independent
    bases, connected by hundreds of metres of tunnels.  Only four are
    inhabited: Tibi, Jolly-Jolly, Shisho, and Drozib.
  - If they come up with a way to survey this big irregular structure:
    - Low light level visible through windows, suggesting reduced power.
    - Some explosion holes: the station has internal airlocks, but at
      least part of it will be in vacuum.
  - A Very Difficult Recon check will spot a wild-eyed face briefly
    peering at them through a window, and then disappear.

- **Getting access:**
  - The main landing area
  - Various access ports around the exterior which connect to
    corridors

- **Internally:**
  - It's cold, but not dangerously so; and the air quality is poor, as
    if the CO2 scrubbers haven't been changed for a few weeks, but not
    yet at toxic levels.  Spending days here would be dangerous, but
    hours would not.
  - There is only emergency lighting.
  - There are several cannibal rage monsters active, *many* sleeping.

  - **Obstacles:**
    - Booby traps: spikes on a stick, tripwires, heavy objects above
      doors, etc (1D damage).
    - Collapsed sections
    - Depressurised sections

  - **Zones:**
    - **Bridge:** lots of seats, screens, computers, all showing the
      "EMERGENCY / QUARANTINE" signal.  One entrance barricaded shut.
      There is an awake cannibal range monster here (25% chance of
      being in rage mode).
    - **Corridors:** long, dark, spooky; the occasional sleeping
      cannibal rage monster, blood on their face and hands.
    - **Views:** lots of glass, showing off space and the planet's
      landscape.
    - **"Port":** (orange)
      - **Landing area:** a flat plane exposed to space with docking
        clamps to hold a ship in place despite the low gravity.  There
        are extendable airlocks, but nobody is around to operate them:
        access to the station is a walk through vacuum.  A few small
        ships are here, dark, clearly unoccupied.
      - **Terminal:** a large open space with seating areas and big
        cargo doors, like an airport terminal.  Slumped against the
        airlock door, not visible from the outside, is a corpse.  It
        looks like a suicide.  Signs pointing the way to RESIDENTIAL /
        EMERGENCY SHELTERS and RESEARCH.  Doors are sealed.
      - **Flight control:** above the terminal, a few blood-stained
        sleeping cannibal rage monsters.
      - **Warehouse:** big storage rooms full of spare parts, imported
        food and medicines, tools, machines, etc; the refrigeration
        has shut down and the food has spoiled.
    - **Residential:** (green) there are 5000 people in each base, so
      these rooms should be big and repeated.
      - **Residences:** mostly empty, some rooms locked shut, with
        movement inside...
      - **Cafeteria / Kitchen:** 12 people dead, hanging off meat
        hooks.  They've been gnawed on by human-looking teeth.
      - **Hydroponics:** some with food crops, some just grass, trees,
        and flowers; overgrown as if they've not been tended in a few
        weeks.
      - **Emergency shelter:** thousands of occupied low berths, bio
        monitors, etc.  Medic check can pick out what identifies the
        infected.  About 10% are: hundreds, maybe even a few thousand
        people.
    - **Science:** (blue)
      - **Hydroponics:** like the residential ones, but mostly alien
        plants.
      - **Small Labs:** little offices with connected labs, holding a
        variety of things: animals in cages (some escaped), colourful
        liquids in vials, weird machinery, etc.
      - **Main Lab:** exposed to vacuum, a mysterious black cube
        surrounded by corpses in hazmat suits.
        - Examining the rubble will reveal that it's in fact a
          disguised Sindalian bioweapon.

- **Ship's records, security camera logs, etc:**
  - Newly-discovered Ancient factory appears to be a bioengineering
    facility --- with some samples still intact!
  - Heavy machinery bringing a large black cube into a lab, scientists
    in bright orange hazmat suits watching on.
  - Two scientists opening the cube, a thick purple mist billows out
    and engulfs them: "oh god, it's eating through the suits!"
  - The scientists stagger out of the fog and collapse.
  - Three run up to help them, and as they're picking the bodies up,
    they lurch forward, and start tearing at the suits of their
    helpers, trying to open them.
  - Someone pulls a stunner, fires, and the electricity ignites the
    purple mist: it explodes, blows a big hole in the station, and
    pressure doors slam shut.
  - Command log: "we now believe some of the mist which affected those
    scientists must have been blown into the station by the blast and
    been pulled into the life support system" "reports of aggression
    in all four sectors" "tried to send a ship for help, but there was
    an outbreak on board and contact was lost" "decided to engage
    emergency protocols and broadcast a quarantine signal"
  - System logs: unknown agent in the air detected on the day of the
    explosion, filtered out over a week ago; CO2 filters need
    replacing ASAP.

- **Cannibal rage monsters:**
  - **Rage mode:** STR 14 (+2) DEX 15 (+3) END 14 (+2) INT 4 (-1) EDU 8 (0)
  - **Fatigued mode:** STR 4 (-1) DEX 5 (-1) END (-1) 3 INT 4 (-1) EDU 8 (0)
  - About 1 in 10 should be wearing some cobbled-together
    post-apocalyptic armour (+4 protection)
  - Some will be armed with a club (1D damage) or a knife (1D+2 damage); skill 1
  - All will insist that it was the *others* who killed and ate
    people; not *them*.
  - They will scurry around beneath the floor.
  - Roll 1d6 as the Travellers move around: 1 means there is an active
    cannibal rage monster in the vicinity!

- **Cannibal rage lab animals:**
  - **Swarm of rats:** hits 20; attack 0 (+ boon); damage 1d2; small (-4)
  - **Badger:** hits 7; attack 1; damage 1d3; small (-2)
  - **Chimpanzee:** hits 13; attack 2; damage 1d6; dmall (-1)

    - Find a survivor
    - See survivor enter rage-mode when another person is found

### Next time

- Exploring Vume


2021-12-12 --- Week 16, Vume
----------------------------

**Lynette's player dropped out due to real-life priorities.**

### Recap

> Last time, you patched your ships up from the pirate attack, and
> handed over the Far Trader, and Astraea's good friend Xavier, to the
> General Development Corporation Bank, for them to run trading
> missions for you, for a modest fee of course.
>
> Then you travelled on to Vume.  It was a peaceful and uneventful
> journey.
>
> On arrival, your ship's alarm started blaring, screens flashing
> "EMERGENCY" and "QUARANTINE" in bold, red, letters!  You couldn't
> pick up any comms chatter.  Flight Control didn't answer your hails.
> You only just picked up a lab ship, drifting powerless dangerously
> close to the system's star, and when you investigated it you found
> signs of, well, space zombies and word of a plague.  Video footage
> of people collapsing, convulsing, and then lunging at, attacking,
> *eating*, others.  You considered turning away, but Ktuarl reminded
> you that there are 20,000 people on that planet, and it would be
> cowardly to not see if there was *any* help you could render.
>
> Vume Station, a network of tunnels and dome-shaped buildings
> criss-crossing the planet's surface, is cold, and mostly empty.  The
> first thing you saw inside was a corpse, its head blown open by the
> gun in its cold hands.  Later you found a corpse which wasn't so
> dead: as you examined it, it woke up and lunged at you, catching you
> by surprise, but you managed to put it down.  Orcan thought it
> wasn't dead, just asleep due to the cold, and you'd woken it up.
> Later you found a survivor: heard them crawling beneath the floor,
> and spotted them through a vent.  He was weak, hungry, slow, and he
> told you what he knew.
>
> It was quick, he said.  There was panic.  No time to investigate the
> pathogen.  And it all happened just after they brought back an
> ancient alien artefact from the ruins discovered a few months ago.
> You decided to head to the control centre, to see if you could find
> out more about what happened here.
>
> Then you saw another figure, standing across the room beyond some
> office cubicles.  You froze.  Suddenly, the silence was broken by
> your survivor's cry of bestial rage, as he sprinted, wild-eyed and
> slavering, towards the other!

### Prep

- Vume: as for previous session.
- Fuel siphon gear cost Cr100,000.
- Need to pay 2x Scout Ship maintenance.

### Notes

- **Vume:**
  - See that the survivor calms down eventually after the fight, and
    is really lethargic.
  - Find The Lab, and see the explosion.  Decide to try to use main
    station systems to learn what happened, since any data here is
    gone.
  - Meet Korin, security guy
  - Break into control room, download data
  - Get story
  - Decide to go to Realgar to get help, since it has a navy base.
- **Realgar:**
  - Persuade them not to just wait for the infected to die before
    sending a medical team.
  - **Vume temporarily designated a Red Zone.**
  - Get collapsible fuel tank, for 3-parsec jumps
  - Play Htoua (it's a tie)
  - **Rumour:** The king of Drinax is plotting revenge against the
    Aslan for destroying the kingdom two centuries ago.
  - **Rumour:** Most of Noricum is uninhabitable, due to the
    bioweapons which felled the empire.
  - Ilijah gets scammed with some "genuine whale artefacts from
    Dolberg"
- **Theev:**
  - Astraea knows the code words to use and the comms channel to send
    them on, and the heading to fly on, to get to the Pirate City.

### Next time

- After Christmas & New Year: 9th of January probably
- Week 20
- Space pirates!


2022-01-09 --- Week 20, Theev
-----------------------------

### Intro

Talk through Asset & Faction handouts, and then:

> Your ship pops out of jump space next to Theev, the pirate world.
> Astraea quickly broadcasts the passphrase over the appropriate comms
> channel, and puts the ship into the right approach vector.
>
> You fly over the barren, dusty, world where no life evolved beyond
> the single-cellular.  It's a planet with vast mountain ranges
> stabbing into the sky, deep canyons and cave systems burrowing into
> the surface, and vast deserts of black sand.
>
> Your ship dives down to what looks like a desert but, just before
> you crash, the surface shimmers and a large hatch opens to let you
> through.  You find yourself in a huge canyon, covered by an
> artificial and disguised roof---transparent from this side---with
> hundreds of skyscrapers rising up from the floor far beneath,
> connected by glass walkways, and hundreds of small ships and grav
> vehicles flitting to and fro.
>
> A male voice comes through your ship's speakers: "Welcome to Theev,
> please proceed to docking bay 2460-A and come to the Port Authority
> to register your vehicle.  An escort will be waiting for you."
>
> You head to the docking bay, set into the side of a skyscraper, like
> an elevated car park but for spacecraft, and the hangar doors close
> behind you.  There's a hiss of air, a large sign saying "ATMOSPHERE
> OK" flashes on, and the interior doors open as a woman dressed in a
> black robe strides through to meet you.

### Prep

#### Entering Theev

- The party will be guided by a Blacksand Widow: a tall, pale woman
  dressed in a black robe with one clearly artificial eye (glowing red
  iris).  She doesn't speak.  Any other Widows they see will look
  and behave identically.

- **Immigration:**
  - Standard questions like:
    - "Have you all visited Theev before?"
    - "What is the purpose of your visit?"
    - "How long do you intend to stay?"
  - Weapons check: nothing that could breach the environment
    (discovery of such a weapon will be dealt with seriously)
  - Brief explanation of the Law of the Lords and Law of the Streets,
    and the currency, since there are new visitors in the party

- **Port Authority:**
  - "How did you know the passphrase and approach vector?"
  - (to Astraea) "Who was the captain of your previous ship?"
  - "Whose ship is it?"
  - (to Ilijah, with a suspicious look at Astraea) "So you are an Imperial Scout on detached duty?"
  - "I strongly recommend you switch your transponder to Passive or Covert mode if you intend to visit Theev again."

- **Currency Exchange:**
  - Credit chips log transactions, so it's easier to fake one large
    currency exchange transaction for some backwater system which
    still uses its own currency, or a withdrawal transaction for one
    which uses physical credit notes, than faking every transaction
    you make on Theev.
  - Hence, merchants on Theev will only accept Theev credits or
    Imperial credit notes.
  - Exchange rate is 1:1 with a 30% surcharge

### Notes

- **Theev:**
  - Astraea's old captain was Isabella of the Green Reaches
  - Switch transponder to passive
  - Visit The Claw, a vargr-owned bar in the lower city:
    - Human bartender
    - Get told about the 30% surcharge, TL restriction, and extra
      charge due to being new
    - Offer of changing money with a 10% fee
  - Meet Drax the Knifer (asset)
    - Agree to take some fake info to a class B starport
- Jump to Noricum (2 jumps)
- **Noricum:**
  - Meet Donus
- Jump to Oghma
- **Oghma:**
  - Scout ship maintenance
  - Hear about the raiders and see one band on the station trying to
    get passage to Theev
  - Rumour: lots of misjumps across the Sindalian Main recently
- Jump to Torpol
- Jump to Drinax
- **Drinax:**
  - Start the Pirates of Drinax campaign

### Next time

- Week 26
- Pirates of Drinax


2022-01-27 --- Week 30, Drinax
------------------------------

### Intro

- Four-week time skip
  - Outfit the Harrier
  - Pay once for scout ship maintenance
  - The Floating Palace is ludicrously opulent but also overcrowded,
    where even the humblest maintenance worker has inherited noble
    titles.
  - Get some more details of King Oleb's plan:
    - Part 1 is to create a significant pirate threat in the region:
      attack shipping, raid starports, blow up fuel depots; but always
      leave survivors to spread the story.  Keep it secret that Drinax
      is backing you.
    - Part 2 is to make the nearby worlds allies and bring them back
      under the banner of Drinax.
    - The goal is to make the Imperium and the Hierate decide the most
      cost-effective way to stop the piracy is to recognise the reborn
      interstellar Kingdom of Drinax as the protector of trade in the
      region.
    - At the end, you're richly rewarded with noble titles and high
      positions in the new Kingdom, and your crimes forgiven: you
      never were filthy pirates, you were always licensed privateers
      carrying out the king's commands!
    - 10% of your spoils go to the King, and the Harrier is returned
      at the end.
  - Get to know some key Drinax figures (introduce these with a short
    scene each):
    - King Oleb, the patron
    - Princess Rao, the mastermind and heir to the throne
    - Prince Harrick, never the same since his resurrection
    - Lord Wrax, commander of the Star Guard and *not* in favour of
      using the Harrier like this
    - Scholar Voha, master of the Scholar's Tower
    - Kasiyl of the Ahroay'if, exiled prince of the clan which bombed
      Drinax
    - Imperial Consul Thao Poloc, historian of Sindal, and neglected
      Imperial ambassador
    - Cleon Hardy, ombudsman of Asim
    - Rachando, trader
  - Get to know some key Floating Palace locations:
    - The Scholar's Tower, best university in the subsector and
      preservers of knowledge.
    - Rachando's Bazaar, supplier of anything and everything, for the
      low price of Drinaxi & Sindalian artefacts.

### Prep

- *First Prize* (Drinaxian Companion)
  - Introduce players to the reality of piracy (through Margaret
    Blaine's advice and stories).  Advice to give (ideally roleplay
    the players figuring this out with hints from Margaret, don't just
    infodump):
    - It's expensive to hunt down a pirate.  A pirate who is just a
      nuisance and steals a bit of cargo now and then, but doesn't
      destroy ships or kill crew, won't provoke a large response.
    - System defences tend to be concentrated around the starport and
      its jump point, whereas other in-system traffic may be barely
      protected at all.
    - Smugglers and other pirates are ideal targets: a criminal can't
      exactly report their ill-gotten gains stolen, and you might even
      be able to take protection money from them in response for not
      turning them in.
    - Always have an escape plan.
    - Starports generally dislike pirates and dealing with stolen
      goods, but they'll often look the other way if you don't bring
      trouble and offer the occasional bribe.  Some ports may even
      openly defend you if you're on good enough terms.
    - Crew morale is essential.  Many a captain has been deposed
      because he didn't divide the spoils fairly, or because he failed
      one too many times.
    - Starports share watch lists of suspected pirate vessels, so you
      should get a legitimate-seeming merchant ship as a fleet tender,
      or establish a safe base where you can rest and resupply without
      needing to hide your identity **(GM Note: constructing a base on
      an appropriate large asteroid or moon costs tens of millions of
      credits and would take a single person with hand tools over 50
      years: so you'll need lots of money, materials, workers, and
      tools.)**
    - Don't pirate too close to your base, but also don't leave a
      conspicuous gap on the map were someone to plot your activities.
    - Indulge your bank balance, not your ego.  People who show off
      attract unwanted attention.
  - Practice a small pirate run: ambushing a ship, boarding, taking
    cargo, fencing it.

- *Honour Among Thieves* (Pirates of Drinax)
  - Start this towards the end of the session, aiming to stop after
    gathering information on Torpol and Clarke (give the players some
    time to pirate by themselves after *First Prize*

### Notes

- **Drinax:**
  - Hire Shayra Ventassen (good engineer)
  - Hire Opal Twice-Vacced (good marine)
  - Hire Cerdic (good marine)
  - Take on the mission

  - Encounter Kasiyl of the Ahroay'if


2022-02-06 --- Week 42, Acrid
------------------------------

### State

- Shayra, Opal, and Cerdic need paying.  And will demand their fair
  share of the profits.

### Prep

- Drinax:
  - Someone stumbles upon the balcony Kasiyl has claimed as his
    territory: a small tent and some roasting meat over a fire.
  - Someone sees a person infected with the fungal parasite being
    taken to the Scholar's Tower for treatment: it's a common parasite
    in the Trojan Reach, but people are usually inoculated in
    childhood.

- *Honour Among Thieves* (Pirates of Drinax)
  - **Keeper Malos:**
    - A dour-looking middle-aged man with short white hair and a
      beard, wearing black robes and on his back a ceremonial
      freezer-tank.
    - "Half a million credits is the reward we are willing to pay, if
      you survive.  It will not last forever, but nor does life."
    - "Death comes to all, but through our efforts, our people rarely
      fall into the True Death.  I do not wish those raiders to be so
      fortunate."
  - **Provost Falx:**
    - Early 30s, very friendly and welcoming, always smiling, makes
      sure his guests are comfortable and have drinks and
      refreshments.  Tall, bald, wearing bright orange robes and
      wearing a golden fez with a scale model of the starport on top.
    - "Would you like drinks?  Or perhaps other refreshments?" he
      snaps his fingers to call over men with serving trays without
      waiting for a response.
    - "It's such a shame your first visit to Torpol was under such
      unfortunate circumstances, you'll have to come back again some
      time!"

### Notes

  - Agree to share profits with crew, persuade them this is instead of
    a salary (they might leave if profits are too low however).

- Empty hex between Argona and Umemii


2022-02-20 --- Week 51, [Empty Hex]
-----------------------------------

### State

- 2 months behind on maintenance (next due in week 54)

### Prep

- **Admin:**
  - **Time:**
    - I've been tracking time when writing up my session notes, but am
      going to start tracking time in sessions too, because:
      - You're 2 months behind on your ship's maintenance.  Being
        behind on maintenance gives a penalty to jumping, so I don't
        want to handwave that away by saying "oh, the characters did
        maintenance at some point"
      - You often dock at a starport, but then fly out to a gas giant
        to refuel.  Flying from the mainworld to a gas giant takes a
        couple of days, and also your ship's fuel processors can only
        do 40 tons/day, so it'll take just over a day to fill your
        tanks with unrefined fuel and then process it.  Which you
        might want to not do if you're in a hurry.
      - Also when at a starport, you generally do things from the
        moment you arrive to the moment you leave.  When do you sleep?
    - I'm not going to track time at the level of hours and minutes,
      but will do at the level of days and weeks.
    - It's now the start of week 51, you're in an empty hex (so, a
      week away from anywhere) with enough fuel for a J-1 in your
      tanks, you're two months behind on maintenance so you get a -2
      penalty to your Engineer (J-Drive) checks, and the next
      maintenance is due in 3 weeks time.
  - **Jumps:**
    - You can jump into a system anywhere, it doesn't have to be at
      the jump limit of the mainworld.

- **Freighters:**
  - Retcon: they're separated by days, not weeks (next arriving in
    week 53 still)
  - **Week 53 Wednesday:** Type-A Free Trader (HG120); Out of Control; MOR 8; Very Long
    - 70 tons pharmaceuticals
    - 20 tons common manufactured goods
  - **Week 53 Sunday:** Aoa'iw-class Light Trader (SR72); Duel of Honour; MOR 10; Very Long
    - Aslan Captain: 30 hits, STR +2 DEX +1; Crescent Blade (damage 2D+3; skill 1); Stunner (damage 3d6; skill 1); Aua-leather (armour +1)
    - 65 tons spices
    - 20 tons textiles
  - **Week 54 Thursday:** Type-A2 Far Trader (HG118); Hot Cargo; Solar Flares; MOR 7; Very Long
    - 64 tons precious metals
  - **Week 55 Monday:** Empress Marava-class Far Trader (HG116); Berserker; MOR 8; Distant
    - Berserker: 30 hits, STR +1 DEX +1 END +1; Cryojet (damage 4d6 (freezes vacc suited targets for 1d6 rounds instead), skill 1); Battle Dress (armour +22, STR +4, DEX +4)
    - 5 tons radioactives (in a hidden compartment)
    - 5 tons luxury goods
    - 45 tons crystals and gems
  - **Week 55 Friday:** Type-A2 Far Trader (HG118); Noble; MOR 8; Very Long
    - Noble: Lord Penford Ffarnham Blinderby of Pichot; SOC +2; convinced this is all entertainment organised by the captain
    - 32 tons textiles
    - 20 tons common electronics
    - 10 tons common ore

- **Drinax:**
  - Someone stumbles upon the balcony Kasiyl has claimed as his
    territory: a small tent and some roasting meat over a fire.
  - Someone sees a person infected with the fungal parasite being
    taken to the Scholar's Tower for treatment: it's a common parasite
    in the Trojan Reach, but people are usually inoculated in
    childhood.

- **Honour Among Thieves** (Pirates of Drinax)
  - Sal Dancet will come to Argona to find the Travellers in week 53
    with a (now 18-week-old) message from King Oleb commanding them to
    solve this issue *before* anyone else, and to present the captured
    pirates as "gifts from ME".
  - **Keeper Malos:**
    - A dour-looking middle-aged man with short white hair and a
      beard, wearing black robes and on his back a ceremonial
      freezer-tank.
    - "Half a million credits is the reward we are willing to pay, if
      you survive.  It will not last forever, but nor does life."
    - "Death comes to all, but through our efforts, our people rarely
      fall into the True Death.  I do not wish those raiders to be so
      fortunate."
    - "Others once stood where you stand now.  None have returned."
  - **Provost Falx:**
    - Early 30s, very friendly and welcoming, always smiling, makes
      sure his guests are comfortable and have drinks and
      refreshments.  Tall, bald, wearing bright orange robes and
      wearing a golden fez with a scale model of the starport on top.
    - "Would you like drinks?  Or perhaps other refreshments?" he
      snaps his fingers to call over men with serving trays without
      waiting for a response.
    - "It's such a shame your first visit to Torpol was under such
      unfortunate circumstances, you'll have to come back again some
      time!"
  - Due to the time since the attacks, there are only recordings.
    Physical signs have been removed or repaired.
  - The Sarcomond is expected to return to Torpol in the next few
    weeks.  Another crew are waiting to talk to him about the attack.
  - A Type-J Seeker Mining Ship (HG112) with pop-up double Pulse Laser
    arrives at the Borite station after the players: pirate hunters.

### Prep

- **Captain Envai's Cavern:**
  - It's in the outer asteroid belt of the Thebus system, which is
    9,000,000,000km long and 150,000,000km wide
  - It's deep inside a large asteroid, connected to the outside by a

      he's pleased to be able to influence Torpol and Clarke, and get
      a contact with an established pirate band, for a bit of space on

- At Hernon's Claim
- Deadline: Monday week 115
- Misdirection: 0
- Maintenance due in week 104

### Prep

#### The Borderland Run

- **Meeting Uilr:**
  - Uilr is a child, not a teenager
  - She'll ask who the Travellers are, and give them an address to go
    to (Hernon Robotics and Electronics) if they seem ok

- **Meeting Hteletoirl:**
  - Khtiiyaheieao will try to get a feel for the passengers before
    Hteleitoirl shows up
  - He will also make the meeting at the shop look like an authentic
    product demonstration / consultation, as cover
  - Hteletoirl is suspicious of the Travellers and asks how they knew
    his real name, and is surprised that Amaldae sent people after him
  - Knowing they have his stuff will lead him to conclude they were
    sent by Amaldae, and so are either allies or managed to deceive
    her
  - He will need a day to sort out his affairs, and to be taken off
    the planet discretely

- **Hteletoirl:**
  - A very *Aslan* Aslan:
    - Tall, muscular, powerful
    - Walks as if he owns the place
    - Looks down at the Travellers
    - Watches them silently and unblinkingly, as if deciding whether
      to pounce
    - Interrupts
  - Tight-lipped about why he needs to get home, just says that he
    must
  - Suggests caution and routes to disguise their destination
  - Says he needs to stop at Sink and The World, and if asked if he
    can do that later, grimly says "there will be no opportunity
    later" (will also say he needs to stop at Sink if players bring up
    potential betrayal)
  - Desperately needs companionship and will warm to the Travellers if
    they treat him well.
  - **Interactions:**
    - Being found sitting alone in the darkened ship at night
    - Asking about expected arrival dates, but not seeming happy with
      knowing everything is going to plan
    - Punching a wall in the cargo hold

- **Mercenary Encounter:**
  - There's a patrol ship at the port and some very rude mercenaries
    asking people's business and looking for an Aslan criminal who
    they heard might be here
  - One of them is Crayg, Ilijah's hateful contact
  - They have the Planetside Security Services logo on their jackets
  - Have them catch Uilr sneaking around

- **Aslan on Tyokh:**
  - I'm thinking tabards with the clan livery?
  - Need to come up with descriptions: this place needs to feel
    *alien*
  - Hit them with some Aslan bureaucracy at the highport

- **Misdirection Index:**
  - +1 for every Voidsedge system visited

-----------------------------

### State

- At Sink
- Sunday, Week 111
- Deadline: Monday week 115
- Misdirection: 10
- Maintenance due in week 113

### Prep

#### The Borderland Run

- Retcon: do they want to have talked to Hteleitoirl about anything
  during their journey?

- No opposition (roll of 18 on misdirection table): the round-about
  route and change of ship completely fooled Hteleitoirl's enemies.
  - Hteleitoirl will comment on this, approving of their wisdom

- **Sink:**
  - Seskahalen encounter: they're on their way out of Sink
  - Hteleitoirl asks for their help in investigating Ehfyo
  - Hteleitoirl will call the travellers his friends if they help him
  - Ehfyo / Hteleitoirl hand-clasping
  - Ehfyo is respectful to the Travellers and treats Hteleitoirl like
    an old comrade.  He won't admit to anything.

- **The World:**
  - Hand-clasping
  - Governor Olc (a timid woman afraid of space) gives the reactor
    part job.
  - Awkward reunion with Elehasei
  - Feast, everyone wearing formal regalia (what do the Travellers
    wear?)
  - One of them calls Hteleitoirl "prince", which the players will
    hopefully latch onto

- **Tyokh:**
  - Hteleitoirl explains that: he won't be able to speak, the
    Travellers may be able to if they impress the clan, and his people
    are impressed by achievement and ostentation.
  - Honour guard of 16 males in ceremonial armour
  - Has huge densely-populated sprawling cities which give way to
    forest and very spread-out settlements
  - Walk to the palace is in a zone of silence, as Aslan fall silent
    and watch the group go by
  - Rumour of The Treasure Ship
  - Rumour that the Htyowao / Hkaaiheir war seems to be coming to an
    end, many ihatei of those clans will be looking elsewhere for
    glory

- **Aslan:**
  - Furniture is big
  - Everything is painted in clan colours with stories of great deeds
    written on them, even the armour they're wearing
  - Buildings and rooms asymmetrical, natural curves which blend in
    with the landscape, hedges, bushes, low walls, multiple doorways,
    bridges, lots of routes between things
  - Kind of traditional-Japanese-mansion-style buildings: one big
    "building" composed of lots of smaller buildings connected by
    paths and intermixed with nature

### Notes

- Week 111:
  - **Sun:**
    - Get evidence from Ehfyo's computer

- Week 112:
  - **Mon:**
    - Refuel
    - Share evidence with Hteleitoirl

    - Hteleitoirl suggests them being an honour guard so they may speak
    - Jump to The World

- Week 113:
  - **Tue:**
    - Get mission from Governor Olc (nervous lady who doesn't like to
      think about space)
    - Feast
    - Learn Hteleitoirl is the Iuwoiko's son
    - Half-heartedly try to convince Hteleitoirl to run, but fail
    - Jump to Tyokh

- Week 114:
  - **Tue:**
    - Present evidence
    - Defuse threat of war
    - Orcan fails to defeat the executioner
    - Hteleitoirl is executed
    - Iuwoiko thanks them for trying and says the clan may have work
      for honourable and trustworthy humans in the future

### Next time

- Forbidden Lands one-shot


Break 1: Forbidden Lands
------------------------

We played a [Forbidden Lands][] conversion of [Winter's Daughter][],
as a way to try out both the system and the Dolmenwood setting.  This
took 2 sessions.

Impressions:

- Dolmenwood has a lot of potential, I definitely want to explore it
  further.
- Winter's Daughter is a great little adventure suitable for low-level
  characters, without much combat (though more can certainly be
  injected), and a nice fairy-tale feel to it.
- Forbidden Lands is alright, but I didn't much like the hexcrawl
  mechanics, and those seem the main reason to use this system over
  another:
  - Each action taking a full 6 hours feels way too punishing for some
    things, like setting up camp.
  - There's a lot of rolling, which is a big contrast to the rest of
    the system.
  - The "getting lost" mechanic is very underwhelming: you can't
    actually get lost, you always end up in the hex you intended.
  - There's no mechanic for exploring!

That last point is pretty bizarre.  I can only assume it's because
non-hidden adventure sites work with the standard Forbidden Lands
setting, in which people have only just become able to leave their
villages again: so having all these secrets lying in plain site, and
somehow unplundered, makes sense; nobody has got there to plunder them
yet.

Arc 2: The Aslan Threat
-----------------------

Trying something different for this bit of the campaign: a more
structured narrative "arc" which ends with Torpol and Clarke either
joining Drinax, or leaving its sphere of influence, depending on the
performance of the Travellers.

The central tension is the Aslan threat:

1. On returning to Drinax (make this happen soon):
   - Run the opening of *Ihatei!*
   - The talk of the court is the rumoured Hierate / Imperium treaty
     allowing the Hierate to claim more worlds in the Reach.
   - **Rao's briefing:**
     - Rao knows of the ihatei threat on Kteiroa, briefed by Kasiyl:
       she briefs the Travellers and gets them to agree to sort it
       out, she doesn't care *how*, just make sure the ihatei don't
       attack Drinax, Asim, Torpol, or Clarke.
     - She also asks what the Travellers have been up to, and will be
       quite impressed by their new friendship with the Iuwoi, should
       they reveal that.
   - **Oleb's show:**
     - Oleb holds a garden party, in attendance are Drinaxi nobles,
       the Travellers, Provost Falx of Torpol (who remembers the
       Travellers fondly and thanks them for his rapid rise to power),
       a Psychopomp of Clarke (not Keeper Malos), Chieftan Galx, and
       Kasiyl (who everyone is avoiding but watching carefully).
     - Oleb announces that things are worse than just rumours: there's
       an ihatei threat!  He shares what Kasiyl has told him, grandly
       promises that "his capable agents" (gesturing at the
       Travellers) will "solve this little problem, as they have so
       many others", and even brag about their "friendship with the
       clans of Tyokh" if they told Rao about the Iuwoi.
     - Use [Game Structure: Party Planning][].
2. Run *Ihatei!*
   - On success, ambassadors very impressed, musings of potentially
     sharing military intelligence in some kind of joint security
     arrangement.
   - On failure, reaction depends on what the ihatei did.  Could range
     from mild disappointment to outright fury or loss of confidence.
3. **TODO:** some other Aslan adventure, maybe *Lions of Thebus* or
   *The Prodigal Outcast*.  Try to involve the Iuwoi.  Something which
   will show the Travellers, and so by extension Drinax, is capable of
   dealing with a different sort of Aslan problem (ideally by
   befriending the Aslan involved): a valuable skill to have in this
   region of space.
4. Result:
   - If successful with both, Torpol decides to join a mutual defence
     & information-sharing alliance with Drinax.  Clarke still
     skeptical, but falls into place shortly afterwards following
     Torpol's lead.  Both worlds added to the Kingdom.  Oleb overcome
     with glee having Torpol, a rich world on the Florial League
     Route, under his thumb.
   - Otherwise, reaction depends on the nature of the failures, but at
     the very least means that Torpol and Clarke won't be entering
     into an alliance with Drinax.

2022-07-10 --- Week 115, Tyokh
------------------------------

### Intro

> Welcome back to /tea/raveller.  Let's recap our story so far...
>
> Way back in week 30, you signed on with King Oleb of Drinax as
> privateers and agents, fulfilling missions and disrupting shipping
> to help rebuild support for the old Kingdom of Drinax, once a mighty
> interstellar power, but bombed into oblivion by the Ahroay'if clan
> two centuries ago for being too greedy with tax on trade passing
> through the Kingdom's borders.
>
> To that end, you helped out the worlds of Torpol and Clarke,
> catching a pirate who dared attack their worlds, presenting him as a
> gift from King Oleb.  This has brought Torpol and Clarke into
> Drinax's sphere of influence, and the three worlds have been
> exchanging ambassadors, gifts, and information ever since.  King
> Oleb is very pleased... but it's not enough!  Neither world has
> formally joined an alliance with Drinax yet!  Oleb demands more!
>
> You've also got up to various other missions around the Trojan
> Reach, making new friends, bumping into old enemies, and making a
> bit of a name for yourselves.  Most recently, you delivered
> Hteleitoirl, second son of the Iuwoi clan lord, to the clan palace
> on Tyokh for his execution.  You managed to uncover evidence of a
> traitor in the Iuwoi ranks, masterminded by agents of clan Htyowao,
> but you weren't able to save Hteleitoirl.  You conducted yourselves
> well, though, and Iuwoiko, the clan lord, has expressed his thanks
> and his respect for you.  You now have some friends in the Hierate.
>
> And that's where we left off last time.
>
> In the week since the execution, you've remained on Tyokh.  Astraea
> gave the poem she composed about Hteleitoirl to Iuwoiko, who was
> appreciative and politely commented that it was good for a human.
> And two interesting things have happened.
>
> Firstly, you've been contacted by an Aslan claiming to be the leader
> of the Rea'a Hrillkhir, some kind of organised crime syndicate.  He
> knew all about your connections with Drinax and the whole space
> piracy thing, and offered you a deal: access to the Aslan black
> markets to fence goods in this sector, if you capture and bring him
> a shipment of high-quality dustspice.  Apparently the very best
> stuff is imported by the Tyeyo Fteahrao Yolr corporation.
>
> Secondly, you've heard rumours than an Imperial Treasure Ship was
> captured by the Aslan pirate Hroal Irontooth.  The general mood was
> a kind of grudging approval.  The Aslan don't like pirates at all,
> considering them dishonourable thieves, but they couldn't help but
> be impressed by someone who took on one of the Imperium's famed and
> well-guarded Treasure Ships, defeating its escorts, and making off
> with the credits, precious metals, and diplomatic papers within.
>
> It's now Monday of week 115.  Orcan's bruises, from his duel with
> the Aslan executioner, have healed.  You're all on Tyokh, with the
> scout ship.  The Harrier is parked at Drinax.  And the Far Trader is
> still doing its thing over at Tobia.  Both the Harrier and Scout
> Ship need maintenance.
>
> What do you do?

### Prep

#### Ihatei! / Friends in Dry Places

- "Word from the Hierate":
  - Rao gives the briefing (Oleb isn't present)
    - Send the Aslan anywhere but Drinax, Asim, Torpol, or Clarke
  - She also asks what the Travellers have been up to, and is
    impressed if they reveal their friendship with the Iuwoi
  - Anything said here is communicated back to Oleb, who may reveal
    things publicly at the garden party
- Kteiroa:
  - Utea is a male (for consistency with *Friends in Dry Places*)
  - If the Travellers arrive in an Aslan ship, they're hailed by
    several ihatei leaders from the camp (as well as by one of Utea's
    wives from the port).  In Trokh, naturally.
  - Routine INT / Streetwise to recognise Utea as being open to
    dealing with pirates and stolen goods.
  - Show "Utea's Banner" handout
  - **In Orbit:**
    - Hundreds of ships of various sizes
    - Mostly 100-ton ihateisho scouts, but there are bigger ships all
      the way up to 2000-ton Sakhai-class assault carriers.
  - **Friends in Dry Places:**
    - Utea will seize the opportunity to have some outsiders do his
      work for him, and will treat the Travellers to dinner and make
      his proposal if they impress him.
    - He wants this all completing as soon as possible since he is
      expecting another wave of ihatei and their leaders to arrive in
      a matter of weeks.
      - If asked why, he can share the tale of the war
  - **Timeline:**
    - Week +0: Travellers get their mission on Drinax
    - Week +7: Iykhi, Toihoi, and 50 new ships of Htyowao and
      Hkaaiheir ihatei arrive
    - Week +9: Iykhi joins Eihei and plans to attack Drinax
    - Week +25: Aslan attack Drinax
- Approaching the Iuwoi:
  - The Iuwoi can't be seen to be helping humans against the Hierate,
    but they do know the political situation and can send along an
    advisor to help the Travellers navigate the camp.
  - The advisor will not suggest courses of action in the open where
    other Aslan may overhear, but can do so from the privacy of the
    Traveller's ship.

#### Garden Party

- Locations:
  - **Hedge maze:**
    - A knee-high hedge maze, which at the press of a button can
      project an opaque leafy barrier to twice human height.  Even
      when the barrier is down, the maze is something of an obstacle,
      as the hedges are too large to gracefully step over.
  - **Fountains:**
    - A pair of marble fountains, water spewing from the gun turrets
      of carven spacecraft.
  - **Stage:**
    - A small wooden stage, erected for the party, with several
      musicians playing classical music from the golden age of Drinax.
  - **Lawns:**
    - A wide open expanse of well-kept greenery.

- Guests:
  - **King Oleb:**
    - King of Drinax

### Prep

#### Ihatei! / Friends in Dry Places

- Approaching the Iuwoi:
  - The Iuwoi can't be seen to be helping humans against the Hierate
    or to be working with an exile (Kasiyl), but they do know the
    political situation and can explain that.

- Tyokh scrap yard:
  - Availability: see *Ships of the Reach*
  - All are demilitarised, with easy-to-access spare or valuable parts
    stripped out: shells of ships really, in bad condition for flying.
  - **Buying:**
    - Office looks like a bridge (eg, seat is a pilot's chair)
    - Run by a Vargr (ksae.gueng.tnek, "jim") & station bureaucracy
      android ("andy")
    - Station won't allow entire Aslan ships sold to non-Aslan
    - Sell for d6 * 10% of the original value
      - Water reclamation is priced as the power plant * 2 (due to
        difficulty of removing just that part)
    - Takes 6 days + (d6 hours per 100 tons of ship)
  - **Stealing:**
    - Ships are in a holding orbit around a rockball
    - Guarded by an automated missile launcher which sends a distress
      message (re-roll 5- on PHR table) if an approaching ship is not
      recognised.
