## Books

This week I read:

- [Trimalchio's Feast][] by Petronius, in the Penguin Little Black Classics collection.

  An account of the decadent feast of Trimalchio, in which everything
  which goes wrong (like a servant forgetting to gut a pig before
  cooking it) is actually part of the act (the pig was gutted, and
  filled with more food).  I think I missed a lot of the nuance, by
  not being familiar with the norms of such a feast, but it was still
  a fun read.

- [Wailing Ghosts][] by Pu Songling, in the Penguin Little Black Classics collection.

  A collection of fairy tales, though if they are as the blurb says
  "Classical China's greatest stories" I'm not very impressed.  Most
  of them are more what I would describe as a *sequence of events*,
  not a *story*.  Some of them have clear morals, like to respect the
  dead or to be polite, others I couldn't really tell what the moral
  was (which may be due to my lack of familiarity with the culture).
  There were a couple of longer stories which I quite liked, King of
  the Nine Mountains was a good supernatural revenge story, but on the
  whole they weren't great.

- [The Melancholy Death of Oyster Boy & Other Stories][] by Tim Burton.

  This is a collection of short poems with illustrations, mostly about
  unfortunate things happening to unfortunate children.  I
  particularly liked *The Boy with Nails in His Eyes*:

  > The Boy with Nails in His Eyes<br>
  > put up his aluminum tree.<br>
  > It looked pretty strange<br>
  > because he couldn't really see.

- [The Doors of Perception & Heaven and Hell][] by Aldous Huxley.

  A pair of essays about one time Huxley had a mescaline trip.  The
  first is about the trip itself and how it affected his senses and
  thoughts, the second is a reflection on visions, and how depriving
  the brain of glucose (as mescaline does, and as fasting and
  self-flagellation can do) may be connected to them.

  I quite enjoyed this.  It's well written, and there's a bit
  somewhere where Huxley says, after talking about how incredible the
  experience was and how connected he felt to the rest of the
  universe, that of course he's not so foolish to believe that the
  drug *actually* gave him some transcendental experience; the whole
  thing was ultimately in his head.  I particularly liked that as I
  *have* had the misfortune of knowing people who talk as if you can't
  *really* understand the universe unless you're on drugs, and that
  people who don't partake are close-minded and missing out.  It was
  refreshing to read an account of a trip in which the author felt
  like he understood the universe and was connected to
  everything... and then go on to say that that insight was ultimately
  something he made up, and not some greater truth.

- [Assassin's Quest][] by Robin Hobb, the third of the [Farseer Trilogy][].

  The end of the trilogy.  A nice story, much smaller in scope than
  Malazan, and it's nice to have a bit of a break from huge epic
  storylines on occasion.  I'm not sure if I'll move onto Robin Hobb's
  other books, there are more series set in this same world, but
  ultimately the world wasn't *that* interesting to me.  It was
  well-written and I got through the books in a day or so each, but I
  don't feel any great compulsion to get more.

Bringing my 2020 total to 99 books.

## Games

We began the Australia chapter of Masks of Nyarlathotep in my [Call of
Cthulhu campaign][].  I had planned to have a climactic ending to the
New York chapter of the story, with a kidnapping and a daring rescue,
but decided that it had been a little time since the previous session,
so it was probably better to move onto the next chapter instead.

I think that was a good decision, the players are having a good time
so far, and are looking forward to reaching the ancient city in the
desert next session.  I'm also quite looking forward to it, because
I've not run this MoN chapter before---my previous group never made it
to Australia---so it's all new to me as well.

I think after months of playing it now, I can definitely say I prefer
Pulp Cthulhu to regular Call of Cthulhu, at least for campaign-style
play.  Player characters are much tougher, and giving them wacky
abilities (one of them had a new skill "Knowledge of the Future of the
Universe" implanted into their brain by an alien) and gadgets is
entirely in-keeping with the tone.

## Miscellaneous

Back to work next week.  This time off has been good, but all good
things must come to an end.  Though I've still got a few days to use
up before April, so I'll be having another little break soon.

I've spent the last couple of days watching a lot of anime, finishing
off things from last season or even earlier, in preparation for the
