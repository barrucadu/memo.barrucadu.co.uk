## Work

This week I massively upgraded my work-from-home set-up.  For months
now I've been using my work-issued laptop, occasionally plugging it
into my external monitors.  I've been grumbling about performance
(particularly when using docker-for-mac, which is a slow unstable
resource hog), but this week a really obvious idea hit me: I have a
far more powerful Linux machine *right there* which I'm not using
during the working day!  Why don't I... work from a proper computer,
rather than a laptop?

So now my daily work machine has a Ryzen 7 2700X with 8 cores, 64 GB
RAM, two Dell UltraSharp U2717D 27" monitors, and a nice mouse and
mechanical keyboard.  *Far* better than a Macbook Pro.  And it's
running Linux, so even if the hardware were exactly the same, docker
would *still* perform better.

I also got to do a lot of programming this week, which was nice.
Somehow the stars aligned and there was a dearth of meetings in the
same week that there were a variety of clear tasks to work on, so I
got stuck into one stream of work while two other devs on the team
focussed on another.


## Books

This week I read:

- [Use of Weapons][] by Iain M. Banks, the third of the [Culture series][].

  Another one I'd read before.  Reading this one while knowing the big
  twist at the end is a very different experience; it's interesting
  picking out all the hints.  Some spoilery examples:

  <div class="spoiler">
  Like a scene where Zakalwe dreams he sees the ghost of the "real
  Zakalwe", which you take to be figurative on a first reading---a
  sign that Zakalwe doesn't feel like he really belongs where he
  currently is; but no, it really means Elethiomel is thinking of the
  real Zakalwe.  Or the fact that Iain M. Banks never uses the
  authorial voice to name the character "Zakalwe", it's always "he",
  "the man they called Zakalwe", and so on; it's only other characters
  who call him Zakalwe.
  </div>

- [The State of the Art][] by Iain M. Banks, a short story collection
  and the fourth of the [Culture series][].

  I'd not read this one before.  A few of the stories are just sci-fi,
  but most have some connection to the Culture.  The titular story,
  which is most of the book, is about the Culture discovery of Earth
  in the 1970s, and the fate of one of the agents who falls in love
  with the planet.  It also features Diziet Sma and Skaffen-Amitskaw,
  who were major characters in Use of Weapons.

## Games

My Call of Cthulhu game has now reached what I consider the *real*
beginning of the Masks of Nyarlathotep campaign[^mon], after 5
sessions.  Things are already going a little differently to when I
last ran this, so I'm looking forward to seeing how things turn out.

[^mon]: The player characters attending the reading of Jackson Elias'
  will and agreeing to continue his investigation and try to bring his
  killers to justice.


## Network rebuild

The saga of the missing UPS package continues.

The last I heard from Ubiquiti support, on Wednesday, was that UPS
needed to get in touch with me and wanted to confirm my phone number
was correct.  I confirmed it.  UPS didn't ring me on Thursday or
Friday.  If it gets to noon on Monday without a call, I'll contact
Ubiquiti again.

I'm not sure why UPS needs to contact me.  The tracking information
still says they're doing an investigation, so it's probably not to
arrange delivery.  If they're certain it's lost for good, I don't know
why they would let me know rather than Ubiquiti.  The only thing I can
think of is if the driver says he *did* deliver it and they want to
check my story; I hope that's not the case, because then this will
just turn into my word against theirs, and it could drag on for even
longer...


## Miscellaneous

This week I set up [automatic tagging for podcast episodes I download
and CDs I rip][], using systemd and inotify.
