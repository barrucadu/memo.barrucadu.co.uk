## Work

I was off work sick this week with...

## Shingles

That's right, I came down with a viral infection during a global
pandemic... and not the one everyone was worrying about.  I came down
with a case of [shingles][], specifically ophthalmic shingles.  It
wasn't much fun, and I didn't know anything about shingles beyond the
name (certainly not enough to recognise it from the symptoms), so I'll
write a bit about my suffering in case it helps you.

First of all, **do not image-search for shingles if you are
squeamish**.  There are some really gruesome pictures out there.
Thankfully my case ended up being pretty mild.

So, what is shingles?  Well, it's the same virus as chickenpox, and
can strike anyone who has had chickenpox---even decades
later!---usually as a result of a weakened immune system, but it can
also just be totally spontaneous.

We don't vaccinate against chickenpox in the UK, and 9 out of 10
adults who grew up here had it as children, so most people in the
country are at risk of shingles.[^vaccine]

[^vaccine]: [The NHS believes][] that vaccinating everyone could
    increase the risk of serious cases of chickenpox or shingles in
    adults.  Chickenpox is a pretty mild condition in children, so the
    NHS prefers that everyone gets it as a child and so develops
    immunity, to the risk of some children missing the vaccine, and
    not catching it because they're surrounded by immune people, and
    then catching it as an adult.  In addition, being exposed to
    active cases of chickenpox boosts the resistance in people who've
    already had it, lessening the chance the virus reactivates and
    causes shingles.  So really, sick children are a force for social
    good.

Here's a timeline of my symptoms, and what I thought was going on:

- **Friday 25th:** I noticed three bumps on my forehead in the
  morning.  They looked like insect bites.  I thought it was weird to
  have three in such close proximity; but I thought "well, I sleep on
  my side, maybe that's just the side of my head which was exposed."

- **Saturday 26th:** More bumps.  I wondered if I had bedbugs, that
  would be bad.  But then realised probably not, because the bites
  were all in one half of my forehead, and a couple on the scalp (same
  half of head), whereas bedbugs would be all over my body.

- **Sunday 27th:** My eye had turned red, and there was a sore bump on
  the back of my neck, near the ear.  I did some research online, and
  thought that it seemed like [viral conjunctivitis][]: the pink eye
  and inflamed could-be-a-lymph-node fit, though the forehead bumps
  did not.  Which had continued to get worse.  So my working
  hypothesis changed to "insect bites, which gave me an infection
  which has caused viral conjunctivitis".

- **Monday 28th:** My eyelids were stuck together with gunk when I
  woke up.  This is one of the signs your conjunctivitis is
  particularly bad and you need to talk to a doctor.  I panicked a bit
  at this point, as I've not registered with a GP in London yet (I
  know, I know, I moved down here over two years ago...), but I found
  [MedicSpot][], a private clinic which does video appointments and
  could get a prescription arranged at a pharmacy near me.  So I
  booked an appointment for 10:30 and messaged my line manager to let
  him know something was up.

  The video call was an interesting experience---moving my phone
  camera around pointing at things and describing what they felt
  like---and after clarifying some things (that I had had chickenpox
  in the past and that all the symptoms so far were on the same side
  of my body), he said "I think it's shingles", and explained a bit
  about what shingles is.  A painful itchy rash which goes away in a
  few weeks, and while I've got it I'm capable of spreading chickenpox
  (not shingles) to people, so I should take care to avoid in
  particular very young children and pregnant women.  "But", he said,
  "you've got it on your forehead, and that's quite dangerous; you
  need to get on antiviral medication *right now*, and get emergency
  medical attention if that eye worsens.  I'll write you an urgent
  prescription, you should get a call in the next 5 minutes about
  where you'd like to collect it from."

  That made me feel a bit less good about things.  I updated my
  manager, took the whole day as sick leave, and got the prescription.
  35 pills, of which I had to take 5 a day, with 4 hours between each
  pill.

- **Tuesday 29th:** My lower eyelid had become increasingly swollen
  and sore over Monday, and was disrupting my ability to sleep.  At
  about 4am, I messaged my manager at about 4am and said I wouldn't be
  in.

  That evening I asked a friend to do some shopping for me, as I
  thought it would be best to self-isolate even if 9 out of 10 UK
  adults wouldn't be able to catch chickenpox from me.

- **Wednesday 30th:** I decided to take the full week off as sick
  leave, as even with painkillers for the eye the rash was quite itchy
  and distracting.  I spent much of the day with a bag of frozen peas
  held against my face.

- **Thursday 1st to Sunday 4th:** I relaxed, kept taking my
  medication, and kept checking on my eye in the mirror.  The
  medication did a very good job stopping the worsening of the
  condition.  No more bumps appeared, the ones there started to scab
  over without oozing, and the eye gradually became less bloodshot.

As of this morning, my eye is not yet fully recovered.  I woke up
again with eyelids stuck together with goo.  But the bumps are looking
pretty good.  I've got a few scabs, but no new bumps have appeared
since starting the medicine.  My pills will run out tomorrow.  The
doctor I spoke to didn't tell me to call back when I ran out for a
check up, so I guess I'll just keep an eye on things and, if it looks
like the shingles are worsening again, get another appointment.

All in all, I wouldn't recommend shingles.  If you are going to come
down with a viral infection, go for a cold instead.

## Books

This week I read:

- Volume 16 of [Nana][], by Ai Yazawa.

  In which we learn dark secrets about Nana's family... volume 17
  hasn't arrived yet.

On Wednesday I thought "great, multiple days off, I'll get loads of
reading done!" but then I didn't feel like it at all.

## Games

This week I decided to put off my Call of Cthulhu session, so I could
put 100% of my effort into relaxing, rather than worrying about doing
preparation or whether I'd be able to wear a headset for 3 hours with
a painful head rash.

## Network rebuild

A few more components trickled in this week.  The network cabinet is
all working now, and has 2U for expansion, which is nice.  I decided
to go ahead and get a fancy router and access point, which should be
here in the next week or so.  That'll take up another 1U.

The brand new WD Green SSD I got for nyarlathotep started having read
errors and corrupting data after 6 days of usage, which was less nice.
I replaced it with a Samsung 860 EVO which seems to be doing fine.

Despite doubling nyarlathotep's RAM, I saw it quickly creep back up to
about as much percentage usage as it was on before, it seems I've got
a few RAM-heavy things running on there.  So I decided to double the
RAM again, bringing it up to 64GB.  With that upgrade in place, it's
been hovering around 60% used for a while, which is nice as it means
there's plenty of room for growth as I add more services.  Though I'm
not sure how it was coping as well as it was when it only had 16GB
total previously.

I'm still waiting for the cables to connect the HDD hot-swap bays, but
I've had a second shipping update and they should be arriving on
Friday.  It's all coming together.
