## Work

This week I took the opportunity to become the tech lead for a new
team which is starting on Wednesday.  This will be my first time tech
leading, so I'm sure there'll be a lot to learn which I can talk about
in this section.

It's a brand new stream of work, with lots of user research to do, and
there's nothing on GitHub yet, so I'll refrain from sharing details
until stuff starts to go live.


## Books

I've decided to try to read 100 pages a day[^reading], to get myself
back in the habit of reading daily and to make some progress through
my ever-growing backlog.

[^reading]: Finishing a book counts as finishing the 100 pages
  regardless of how many I actually read.

This week I read:

- **Gardens of the Moon,** by Steven Erikson, the first of the
  [Malazan Book of the Fallen][] series.  It starts *in media res*,
  with lots of characters and events, and took a couple of chapters to
  get into.  I've seen someone on Reddit describe it as if <abbr
  title="A Song of Ice and Fire">[ASoIaF][]</abbr> started in the
  middle of Robb's war in the North: there are clearly things going on
  elsewhere in the world, and sometimes people from elsewhere show up,
  but you only have enough information to put a small part of the
  picture together.

  It's apparently much weaker than the rest of the series.  I think
  that's fantastic news, because I really enjoyed it; so if the rest
  is even better, great!

- **Anecdotes of the Cynics,** in the [Penguin Little Black
  Classics][] collection.  The Cynics were a bunch of Greek
  philosophers who aspired to asceticism, so that they would be
  content in just about any situation.  It was a significant influence
  on Stoicism.  Though, there does seem to be some question of whether
  Diogenes, a great Cynic philosopher, was actually just vain: is it
  really virtuous to flaunt your lifestyle in front of others?  Or is
  that just vanity?  I liked this anecdote:

  > He [Diogenes] once begged money from a statue.  Asked what he was
  > doing, he answered, "Getting used to being refused."  When he
  > begged---a practice he began owing to his poverty---he used to
  > say, "If you've given to others, then give to me too; if you
  > haven't, now's a good time to start."

I also published [my book wishlist][].
