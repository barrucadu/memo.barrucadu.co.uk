## Work

This week didn't feel that productive, it was mostly meetings: I gave
a presentation at our Tech Fortnightly about [Compute@Edge][], had a
call with Fastly to ask them some questions about it, and had another
catch-up with the Digital Identity team about the upcoming launch of
*the* cross-gov auth service.  Hopefully we'll have something we can
start to integrate with shortly, and then when that's done and the
users are migrated across we can switch off [our long-lived
prototype][].

Next week I'm going on support on Wednesday.  It'll be nice to have a
change from team stuff for a week (and hopefully nothing will break).

## The Plague

I'm getting my second jab next week, though I don't really anticipate
changing my behaviour: living as a hermit is quite nice, actually.


## Books

I didn't finish any books this week, but I have a few in progress.


## Gaming

I've been invited to join a *third* weekly game, this one on Tuesdays,
and we'll be starting with Traveller!  For once, I'll get to *play* a
system I also *run*, how novel.

It's a new group, so I don't know if it'll work out, but I'm looking
forward to giving it a chance.
