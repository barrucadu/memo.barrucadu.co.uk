## Work

This week... what *did* I do?  I think next week I'll go back to
making a list of things I want to get done, as I felt like I achieved
more when I was doing that, and it was easier to write this section of
the weeknote.

I didn't stop for any particular reason, I just... stopped.

Anyway, this week I continued working on email things.  We've now got
a "log in to manage your notifications with your GOV.UK account" thing
running in staging, which needs a bit of tweaking to meet current
designs.  But hopefully we can launch that soon.

I also had a few meetings with the Digital Identity programme, who are
developing the cross-gov auth thing, to talk about how we'll migrate
users out of our prototype auth thing and how account management will
work.


## Books

This week I've been reading [Olympos][] by Dan Simmons, but I've not
finished it yet.

## Gaming

### Godbound

This week I finished off the Godbound one-shot I started two weeks
ago.

Godbound is a system I've wanted to try out for a long time but,
having now done so, I don't think I'll be going back to it.  I found
it really hard to come up with challenges when the PCs have powers
like:

> Those reduced to zero hit dice or hit points within 200 feet of you
> automatically stabilize or die as you wish.  If you desire it,
> willing living creatures at zero HD or hit points around you may
> continue to act for as many rounds as you have levels before they
> unavoidably fall dead.

Or,

> You have mastered all spheres of mortal academic knowledge.  You
> always know the answer to any question involving such learning, if
> any mortal sage knows it and automatically succeed on attribute
> checks to accomplish intellectual tasks if they're within mortal
> capabilities.

A game where the PCs are demigods sounds fun.  But how do I challenge
those demigods without pitting them against magical foes who can just
negate their powers?  And if I do that, what's the point of even using
this system in the first place?

### Traveller

I've continued thinking about an upcoming Traveller campaign, and got
the players on board with my campaign pitch.  There are a few options
which we'll have to discuss in session 0, whenever that happens, but
basically it boils down to:

- A human-focussed campaign (at most one alien PC)
- Set in the [Trojan Reach sector][], which is a bit of a political powder-keg
- A mostly episodic style, but where the PCs have long-term goals
- And they're likely a gang of space pirates

I think that's a recipe for fun.

## RPG Blog

This week I published an article about why you should [run a
mid-campaign check-in][], inspired by the one I did for my Call of
Cthulhu campaign a few months back.

## Miscellaneous

I've had another batch of hardware-related bad luck this week.

I got some new CDs, and discovered that my USB CD drive was dead: I
could put a disc in and it would give it one or two feeble spins, but
it wouldn't consistently spin and the computer wouldn't recognise it.

And then today, my mouse started playing up!  It seems to be a problem
with the mouse itself, as in both Linux and Windows it'll sometimes
become unresponsive.  In Windows, I can fix it by locking and
unlocking the screen, in Linux by unplugging it and plugging it back
in again.

So I've now got a replacement CD drive, but the mouse issue began
after ordering that, so I won't get a new mouse until next week.
