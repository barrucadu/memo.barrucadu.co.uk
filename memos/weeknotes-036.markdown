## Ph.D

- The [Journal of Functional Programming put out a call for Ph.D
  abstracts][], so I sent mine in.

## Work

- I spent much of the week recovering from a cold which started [the
  previous weekend][], I took Monday off and then worked from home
  until Friday.

- I started making changes to [licence-finder][] and [search-api][] to
  make them compatible with Elasticsearch 6.

## Miscellaneous

- My [Call of Cthulhu campaign][] reached another significant
  milestone this week, complete with magical visions and fleeing the
  country.

- I read [The Hill of Dreams][] by Arthur Machen, which is about a
  young man trying to find his way in life.  I've seen it described as
  Arthur Machen's finest work, and I can sort of see that, it is very
  well written.  But I didn't find it as engaging or as enjoyable as
  his more weird fiction like [The Great God Pan][].
