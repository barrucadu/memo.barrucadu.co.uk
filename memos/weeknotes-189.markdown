## Work

It's hard to know what to write in this section when it's all
closed-source now.  This week I finished off an implementation plan
for some scalability work we want to do, and began working through it.


## Books

This week I read:

- [Lord Valentine's Castle][] by Robert Silverberg

  I really liked this one, in fact I think I should check out more by
  Robert Silverberg.  I've previously [enjoyed his Downward to the
  Earth][] too.

  This was interesting because the book "spoils" itself almost
  immediately.  You learn what's going on within the fifty or so
  pages: Valentine, a juggler with no memory, is actually Lord
  Valentine, king of the world, and had his memories erased and his
  mind transplanted into another body, so that a usurper could rule in
  his stead.  In fact, the hardest character to convince is Valentine
  himself.  So the book is about how Valetine makes it back to his
  castle and wins everyone over on the way, finally confronting the
  usurper.  It's short, only 466 pages in my copy, and it's a
  page-turner.

  I also liked the character names in it.  Often, particularly in
  RPGs, character names are pretty boring.  Lord Valentine's Castle
  has its share of boring character names, like Sleet, Carabella, and
  Valentine; but it also has weird and interesting names like Zalzan
  Kavol and Simonan Barjazid.  I think what makes those names special
  is that *they actually sound like names*.  Too often a fantasy or
  sci-fi name is just a collection of weird letters and punctuation
  marks, or a transparent pastiche of a more famous fantasy name, or
  otherwise just sounds *fake*.  Whereas those names sound like they
  could actually *be* names from a different culture.

## Miscellaneous

As mentioned [last week][], I've finally got into sourdough.  My
starter is healthy, and I've made my first loaf of bread.  It turned
out really well: it rose better than my bread usually does and, while
the sour taste isn't particularly strong, it is noticeable.

I made the bread with a mixture of rye flour and wholegrain flour.  I
want to try it with some white flour next, to compare.  I think the
sourness will be more noticeable in white bread, as the bread itself
has a weaker flavour.  I'm also going to experiment a little with
baking times and temperatures.  The recipe I've been using calls for
baking at 250C, but I've seen a few similar recipes this week which
called for 180C and more time.
