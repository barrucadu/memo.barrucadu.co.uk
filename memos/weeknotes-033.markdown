## Work

- I was off on Friday, the main things I got done this week were
  reviewing code, deleting other code, and writing an ADR
  (architecture decision record) for [the changes we made to search
  last quarter][].

## Miscellaneous

- I decided to buy some Call of Cthulhu rulebooks, having spent maybe
  50 hours playing it since September.  So I now have the Keeper's
  Guide, the Investigator Handbook, the [Masks of Nyarlathotep][]
  campaign books, and a book of beginner-friendly scenarios.

- I visited some friends in Cambridge over the bank holiday weekend,
  and I took the book of Call of Cthulhu scenarios with me.  I ran
  Servants of the Lake, which ended with one player dead, the rest
  fleeing into the night; and no trace when they returned with the
  police...  Four of the players had never played before, and despite
  taking longer than I expected, I think it went pretty well.
