## Work

What *have* I done this week?  Looking at the team Trello board, it
mostly looks like smaller things which, surely, didn't take a whole
week to do.  But I guess we all have weeks like that sometimes.

I've taken next week off work so, together with the VE day bank
holiday, I've got a 10-day break.


## The Plague

No news.  Does that mean it's good news?


## Miscellaneous

This week I read [Assassin's Apprentice][], by Robin Hobb, and started
on [Neuromancer][], by William Gibson.  I got through Assassin's
Apprentice in a day, it was a nice straightforward story.  I'll be
getting the other Farseer books at some point.

I got some new books too:

- Mimes and The Book of Monelle, by [Marcel Schwob][]
- Mysteries of the Worm, a collection of stories by [Robert Bloch][]
- A graphic novel adaptation of [The Dream-Quest of Unknown Kadath][]
- [Trouble with Lichen][], by John Wyndham

I also [rewrote bookdb][], fixing a few annoyances with the old
version and improving the UI for adding and editing books quite a lot.

In my free time next week, I'm planning to finally get around to
reviewing a bunch of lists of book recommendations I've got bookmarked
(including the Fantasy Masterworks and SF Masterworks catalogues).
