## Work

This week, I arranged to leave GDS.  My final working day will be
Wesnesday the 9th of February.

I've been there working on GOV.UK for almost four years now, but over
2021 I began to feel in need of a change.  I'm sure I could have
changed teams if I'd asked, but the team wasn't the issue: I still
enjoyed working on accounts.  I wanted to do something more different
than just changing teams within GOV.UK, or GDS, could give me.

There are also some issues I have with the organisation, like how GDS
blends people management and technical leadership: all senior
developers are expected to be line managers, and that's just not
something I enjoy much.  Mentoring is fine, performance evaluations
(and so on) less so.  So I also wanted to find a job with opportunity
for growth without dipping into management.

I'm kind of picky with jobs.  I don't just want *a* job, I want an
*interesting* and *enjoyable* job.  The recruiter-spam I get every
week on linkedin is almost totally irrelevant or uninteresting, so I
had to try to think of companies that seemed like they would be good
to work for, and submit applications the old fashioned way.

Here are my job hunt stats:

- I picked my first candidate in August (but ended up not applying
  after chatting to someone I know who worked there).
- I sent a total of 8 applications, of which:
  - 2 never responded
  - 5 rejected me before an interview
  - 1 rejected me after a technical interview
- I responded to one linkedin recruiter in December, and that landed
  me my new job.

The new job is with [GoCardless][].  My previous line manager at GDS
actually moved there during my job hunt, so I was aware of the company
and thought it sounded interesting, but didn't really consider
applying until they reached out to me (it seems they're hiring a lot
lately).

Interestingly, I'm going to be a mid-level developer there.  It's
funny how you can go from leading a team at one job to just being a
regular dev working on tickets at the next.  Getting promoted to
senior again will be one of my short-term goals.

I don't know what I'll be working on yet, but I'll be starting on
Monday the 8th of March.
