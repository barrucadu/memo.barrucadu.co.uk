Peru session 1, 2018-09-29
--------------------------

You all responded to a newspaper advert looking for participants in an
expedition to find an unknown pyramid in Peru, organised by one
Augustus Larkin.

In Lima, Peru, you met Augustus Larkin, a sickly looking white man
with a British accent, who you noticed is possibly suffering opioid
withdrawal symptoms; Luis de Mendoza, a Hispanic-looking man, who is
Larkin's silent and imposing assistant; and Jesse Hughes, an
African-American folklorist.  "Jesse Hughes" is actually an alias he
has given Larkin, his real identity is Jackson Elias, a not-unknown
author who investigates and writes about real-world cults.

Over dinner, Larkin gave you an overview of the expedition and what he
hopes to find.  Afterwards, Jackson Elias revealed that he has doubts:
he's in Peru to investigate an ancient death cult behind the legend of
the "kharisiri", fat-sucking vampires.  Mendoza has a fearsome
reputation, and Larkin is acting strangely; Jackson Elias thinks that
they, the pyramid, and this expedition are all connected to the cult
somehow.

You, and Jackson Elias, are staying in the Hotel Maury; Larkin and
Mendoza are staying in the Hotel Espana.  The expedition leaves the
morning of the day after tomorrow to Puno, and from there into the
mountains: so you have one evening and one full day in Lima.

The following morning you went with Jackson Elias to meet with
Professor Memesio Sanchez, a respected archaeologist and historian at
the local university. Professor Sanchez has offered numerous times to
help Larkin's expedition, but been rebuffed or ignored every time.  He
thinks that Larkin plans to steal the pyramid's historical treasures
and take them abroad, which the law currently does not prevent.  He
and his assistant, the undergraduate Trinidad Rizo, have been
conducting research into the possible location of the pyramid, based
on documents in the university archives.

Rizo was taking an unusually long time to arrive at the meeting, so
you---not including Jackson Elias and Professor Sanchez---went to the
store room to investigate.  There you found signs of a struggle, and
Rizo's dead body.  Boxes had been knocked off shelves, and she was
partly buried.  You found the skin stretched tightly over her bones,
as if the fat had been removed from her body, and a large circular
wound in her chest.

---

It is now around noon.

Dr. Crane, you were examining the body.

Lady Ashdown, you had found footprints leaving the room.

What are the rest of you doing?


Peru session 2, 2018-10-27
--------------------------

Still reeling from the shock of finding Rizo's damaged body,
Prof. Musgrave ran back to the office to fetch Prof. Sanchez and
Jackson Elias.

Dr. Crane, as he finished his examination of the body and climbed to
his feet noticed two things previously missed: a sheet of handwritten
paper sticking out of Rizo's jacket pocket, and the glint of gold from
a crate next to her body.  You all read the paper while you waited for
Prof. Musgrave and the rest to return: it was Rizo's notes on "The
Final Confessions of Gaspar Figueroa", a conquistador who came to Peru
in 1541.  The notes describe how he and his companions---Hernando
Ruiz, Diego Garrido, Luis de Mendoza, and Pedro de Velasco---found an
ancient temple near Lake Titicaca full of gold, how they removed some
of the gold and, that night, all turned into ravenous monsters who
pursued Figueroa.  Figueroa eventually arrived in Lima, wasted and
weakened by his ordeal, still carrying the gold they removed.  For the
rest of his days, Figueroa was plagued by hearing the voices of his
friends, crying out in inhuman hunger; and another voice, ancient and
seductive, promising him eternal life if he returned to the temple.

Musgrave, Sanchez, and Elias all arrived back.  Prof. Sanchez, shocked
and grieving, collapsed to the floor next to Rizo's corpse; Lady
Ashdown examined the gold in the crate, and found it to be a solid
gold band covered in geometric shapes, with ragged edges as if it had
been torn from a larger design, and managed to get enough sense out of
Prof. Sanchez to learn that this gold was found with the Gaspar
Figueroa documents.  The crate itself looked like it had been torn
apart, rather than being damaged by simply falling to the floor as a
shelf was knocked.  Furthermore, she noticed that the gold, while cold
to the touch, had burned scraps of skin stuck to it, as if someone had
tried to pick it up while red hot.

You all argued about how best to distribute weapons amongst the party
as you pursued the presumed attacker by following the bloody
footprints, until Sanchez cried out "we have to call the *police*!"
You decided to split up: Jackson Elias and Prof. Sanchez would go back
to his office to call the police, Wilhelmina would stay here to watch
the body, and the rest of you would follow the footprints.

The footprints became harder and harder to track, and you lost them
back in the corridor leading to Prof. Sanchez's office.  In front of
you was the door outside, to your left were the offices.  Lady Ashdown
and Jason Steele went outside, Dr. Crane and Prof. Musgrave decided to
go check out the offices.  As they arrived at Prof. Sanchez's office,
Prof. Musgrave glimpsed a face peering in through the window, which
quickly disappeared.  The window looked out onto an area behind the
university building full of trees and shrubbery, with no paths and few
visitors.  You both, and Jackson Elias, climbed out of the window, but
couldn't see anyone.  Prof. Musgrave heard quiet footsteps not very
far away, as of someone trying to sneak away, and ran towards the
source.

Prof. Musgrave emerged into a clearing, to find Luis de Mendoza, who
turned slowly and fixed the professor with a silent gaze.  Dr. Crane
and Jackson Elias caught up as you stared each other down.
Prof. Musgrave drew a gun, and tried to question Mendoza: silence.
Jackson Elias tried in Spanish: silence.  Dr. Crane went to fetch the
others; after he left, Mendoza charged Prof. Musgrave, who shot him
twice without slowing him down.  Mendoza barreled into the professor,
tackling him to the ground, but got shot at point-blank range by
Jackson Elias, flinging him off, and he lay still.  Everyone but
Wilhelmina, who was still watching the body, showed up a few minutes
later.  Dr. Crane examined the body and said that no man could survive
that.  About half an hour later, the police showed up and took over.

You decided to go confront Larkin, to see what he knew about Mendoza
and, if nothing else, to tell him he needed a new bodyguard as you'd
killed his current one.  You arrived at the Hotel Espana and met the
aged proprietor, Petronila Cupitina, who directed you to Larkin and
Mendoza's rooms.  Both were silent.  After fiddling around with
lockpicks and considering scaling the exterior of the building, you
discovered Larkin's room was actually unlocked all along, and
cautiously entered.  The room was a tip, with things scattered
everywhere.  There you found Larkin, out of his mind on a large dose
of heroin, which Dr. Crane estimated would not be fatal, but which
would last several more hours.  Larkin vaguely recognised you, but was
unable to do anything more than suggest that you meet some other time.

You decided to snoop around and look for clues.  Wilhelmina
unsuccessfully tried to find a map to the pyramid.  Jackson Elias
noticed that Larkin had a large tattoo on his check: of a person, but
in the place of his head was a large spiral.  He recognised this as
the symbol of the Cult of the Bloody Tongue, a particularly violent
Kenyan cult, and had no idea what would bring them to Peru.  Under the
stench of Larkin's strong cologne, Lady Ashdown noticed the faint
smell of rotting meat.

You then broke into Mendoza's room.  In contrast to Larkin's, it was
spotlessly clean, as if it had never been used.  Again, Wilhelmina
unsuccessfully looked for a map.  Jason Steele found a small mirror of
polished gold beneath the mattress, the only personal item in the
room.  Prof. Musgrave examined it... and had a brief vision of white
tentacles bursting through a pyramid.

You decided to come back after a few hours to talk to Larkin when he
was sober again.  Prof. Musgrave went back to his hotel room to rest.
The rest of you confronted Larkin, telling him that Mendoza had killed
a girl at the university, and asking how long Mendoza had been in his
employ.  Larkin expressed shock and disbelief that Mendoza would do
such a thing, and said that he had only known Mendoza for a few
months.  Lady Ashdown realised that Larkin was lying.  Larkin seemed
to have no recollection of your visit that afternoon.

The following morning, you set off to Puno in the Andean foothills.
Larkin was determined that the loss of Mendoza not slow down the
expedition.  This was an uneventful three-day journey by truck, during
which you fought off altitude sickness.

You had one night to rest in Puno before heading out the next morning
to the pyramid on foot.  Most of you chose to stay in the hotel, but
Wilhelmina decided to roam the streets.  She realised an old woman was
following her, and confronted this person.  The old woman asked if
Wilhelmina was with Larkin and, upon hearing that she was but that she
didn't trust Larkin, the woman said to follow her.  She said her name
was Nayra, and that she didn't think it was a good idea to go with
Larkin to the pyramid.  She told a local legend, of an unknown dark
god that fell from the sky into Lake Titicaca, and brought hunger and
famine with it.  One day a hero lured the god into a cave, which was
full of the most delicious tubers and grubs; and sealed the cave with
huge rocks.  A pyramid was then built over the cave, with spells
worked in gold to keep the god imprisoned forever.  Wilhelmina
wondered aloud if the god had escaped[^peru2_1], at which Nayra
crossed herself[^peru2_2] and shuddered.

[^peru2_1]: Out-of-character at this point you were discussing a few
  theories: such as if the golden band at at the university which
  Gaspar Figueroa brought from a pyramid was part of the golden seal
  used to keep the god imprisoned, and if Mendoza was some aspect or
  manifestation of this god who had escaped when the seal was broken.

[^peru2_2]: Nayra seems to follow a mixture of Catholicism and local
  beliefs.

The following morning, you discussed what you knew, and sent a
telegram off to Prof. Sanchez detailing your findings.  You thought
that you might need to bring the gold band to the pyramid, so it's
best for him to be prepared.

You then set out into the jungle with Larkin, using pack animals to
carry your supplies.  No locals would accompany you now.  After a few
hours you stopped for lunch, and Lady Ashdown spied a majestic jaguar
in the distance.

That night around 3am, the noise of one of the pack animals in
distress alerted Dr. Crane, who was on watch, and awakened Lady
Ashdown, a light sleeper.  You found a filthy man, stinking and
dressed in rags, pinning one of the animals to the ground with his
face pressed into it.  Lady Ashdown hit the man in the head with a
crowbar, knocking him off the animal, and revealing that his mouth was
no human mouth: it was circular and full of sharp teeth, much like a
lamprey.  The rest of you had awoken at this point, and easily dealt
with the man.

---

It is now around 3am.

You're all standing around the body of a lamprey-man who was feeding
on one of your pack animals, whose head has been smashed in with a
crowbar.

What do you do?


Peru session 3, 2018-11-11
--------------------------

Dr. Crane examined the body of the man who attacked your pack animals,
and the wound on the animal, and determined that it matched the wound
on Rizo's body back in Lima.  He judged that it was probably a similar
creature which had attacked her.  Larkin appeared shocked, asking
"what was that man?", but you realised he was lying: he seemed
surprised that the attack had occurred, but not by the man's
existence.  You buried the man and the animal to avoid attracting
scavenging animals, and returned to bed.

The second day and night of your journey passed uneventfully.

In the third afternoon, you saw two people heading in the same
direction as you, half a mile ahead.  Larkin suggested they may be
local farmers.  You failed to catch up with them.

You arrived at the pyramid, looking down upon it from half-way up a
mountain.  The plateau which held it had no vegetation, just dirt,
rock, a pit next to the south wall, and the part-buried pyramid with a
crack running along the top.  Two figures were below: you could see
one standing next to the pyramid, and one climbing the side.  The one
climbing the side crouched over the crack for a few minutes, then both
went to the pit next to the south wall and climbed down.

The air swarmed with flies, which Prof. Musgrave identified as
bloatflies, which feed on carrion.

You descended to the pyramid and had a look around.  You found:

* The pit the people had climbed down into, which was full of
  emaciated and shrunken bodies in various states of decay; the air
  full of flies and the stench of death.
* The crack atop the pyramid, about 5cm wide, which did not offer a
  clear view.  It also stank of corruption and swarmed with flies.
* A couple of shafts covered with stone slabs, which appeared to
  descend to some underground tunnels.

You decided to wade through the bodies, following the two people, to
reduce the risk of being caught unawares if you used a different
entrance.  Larkin feigned his illness acting up to avoid going in, but
when confronted confessed that he suffered claustrophobia, and didn't
realise just what it would be like at the pyramid.  Jason Steele
stayed with Larkin while the rest of you descended.

Wandering the narrow tunnels, you found a room full of shiny trinkets
from all ages: coins, jewellery, watches, cutlery, and so on; gathered
and piled up with no apparent organisation.  You also saw the two
people from earlier, fast asleep on filthy mats on the floor.  They
were thin, unnaturally so, but didn't appear to be suffering for it.

You tried to bind the two people, a man and a woman, without waking
them up.  You succeeded with the man, but the woman woke up, but you
managed to subdue her.  You tried questioning her, but got no answer.
You tried giving her food, which she ate, but not with the reckless
abandon you would expect from a victim of starvation.  Leaving them
behind, you continued to explore the tunnels.

You arrived at the buried walls of the pyramid, which had a
familiar-looking golden band embedded into them.  You followed the
band, and reached a point where it had been torn away.  There was a
crack along the wall from the floor to the ceiling, and a hole in the
floor which had filled with a rank-smelling white liquid.  Lady
Ashdown saw rippling in the pool, as if something were moving beneath
the surface.

Dr. Crane lowered a sample container into the pool, and the ripples
surged towards it.  He withdrew the container and examined the
contents, but without much insight.  He tried setting it alight, and
it burst into flames with such a violence he started and dropped the
flaming container into the pool, setting the whole thing alight.
Black smoke billowed into the tunnel.  Jackson Elias dropped to the
ground, and to fresh air, dragging Wilhelmina with him; but the rest
of you inhaled the smoke and collapsed unconscious.

On the surface, Jason Steele saw the smoke emerging, and tried to move
one of the stone slabs covering the shafts, to let the smoke escape
more rapidly.  As he was struggling with that, he heard footsteps from
behind.  He turned, and it was Larkin, but not Larkin as you knew him.
This Larkin stood straight and tall, with no sign of his usual
illness, and his eyes were totally black.  Jason Steele felt his mind
go blank as Larkin said "you will go into the pyramid and destroy the
golden seal."

Jason climbed down into the tunnels, touching the golden band.  He
briefly fought to overcome this compulsion upon him, but could not.
He struck the band with a crowbar, creating a new crack.  A brief
earthquake shook the ground.

Lady Ashdown, Dr. Crane, and Prof. Musgrave regained consciousness
just in time to see Jason Steele strike the band and feel the ground
shake.  "What have you done," Prof. Musgrave cried, and Jason Steele
babbled for a few moments about Larkin.

You decided to try repairing the golden band with the gold in the
other room, as the band was set into the wall of the pyramid, so it
was clear where gold needed to be.  Prof. Musgrave hammered the golden
mirror he found in Luis de Mendoza's room into the cavity in the wall.
You all then turned to go fetch more gold to finish the repair, and
were confronted by Luis de Mendoza, seemingly back from the dead.

"Destroy the seal," he said, the first words you had heard him speak.
He had a gun aimed at you.  When you didn't cooperate, he shot
Prof. Musgrave, who failed to dodge, and lay on the ground bleeding
heavily.  Jason Steele shot Mendoza twice with his shotgun, inflicting
a terrible wound, and knocking him back onto the ground, apparently
dead once more.  The horror of what you all just witnessed began to
sink in: a dead man came back to kill you.  Dr. Crane picked the
bullet out of Prof. Musgrave and bandaged him up.  Prof. Musgrave
gained a nascent phobia of bullets.

You quickly fetched more gold and continued the repair, but nothing
seemed to happen.  Jason Steele decided to pick up Mendoza's body and
see if the seal burned it, like the fragment of seal in the university
storage room did.  But as he picked up Mendoza, the body crumbled away
into dust.  You dashed back to the room with the two people in, and
saw that the man had also turned to dust.  The woman was still alive,
but looked incredibly feeble, and seemed to worsen before your very
eyes.  She seemed confused and afraid, asking what was happening.
Prof. Musgrave offered her some food, but as she reached out her arm
to take it, she fell back dead.

Jason Steele and Prof. Musgrave came out onto the surface to find
Larkin sitting down, looking very feeble, with no sign of the power
which had filled him before.  He told you that he had come to this
pyramid once before, with some locals, and that he didn't really
remember what happened.  He found himself back in Lima, with a
compulsion to find some people to take to the pyramid and destroy the
golden seal.  He couldn't do it himself, it repelled the power within
him.  This is where you, and his expedition, came in.

You then lowered a rope down one of the shafts for the rest of you to
climb out.  Jackson Elias carried a bag full of golden coins, and said
sheepishly "well, this is why we came, right?"

Then we had a time skip to everyone parting ways at the port in Lima.

None of you seemed particularly sad to be leaving Peru, and a few of
you said you'd hope to never cross paths with Larkin again.  Larkin
said that he was just glad everyone survived this expedition, and that
he hoped nothing like this would ever happen again.  Jason Steele and
Dr. Crane realised Larkin was lying; but the point of no return had
been passed, and they couldn't turn back to confront him.

---

This is the end of this chapter.  Bonus sanity points are:

* `+1d6` for killing Luis de Mendoza.
* `+1d8` for restoring the ward on the pyramid.

The next chapter is after a four-year time skip.  We'll start with a
brief character-tweaking phase where I'll award some bonus skill
points.


America session 1, 2018-11-24
-----------------------------

It's 1925, four years after the events of Peru, and you have all
received a message from Jackson Elias saying that he's uncovered new
information about the Carlyle Expedition, and needed a reliable team
of investigators to help him.

The Carlyle Expedition of 1919 was an archaeological expedition to
Egypt funded by wealthy playboy Roger Carlyle.  After Egypt, the
expedition went to Nairobi, to unwind on a safari.  That was the last
time the expedition members were seen alive.  Two months after their
disappearance, Erica Carlyle, the sister of Roger Carlyle, arrived in
Nairobi with an expedition of her own: to find her brother.  The
remains of the Carlyle Expedition were found, massacred by tribesmen,
who were executed for their crimes.  This was all over the newspapers
of the time, and it was thought to be a settled issue.  Jackson Elias
finding new information is quite a surprise.

On the morning of the 15th of January, the day Jackson Elias asked to
see you all, you all made your way to Prospero House, Jackson's
publisher, to ask about his whereabouts, as his message was
nonspecific.  There you were reunited with Wilhelmina, who has moved
to New York and is working there as a secretary.

You met Jonah Kensington, the owner of Prospero House and Jackson's
friend, who told you that Jackson is staying in room 410 of the Hotel
Chelsea.  You made your way to the Hotel Chelsea and were directed to
room 410 by a man at the reception desk.

Upon arriving at room 410, you found the door locked, and no answer to
your knocking.  You noticed some workmen on the fire escape outside,
and asked if they'd seen a man matching Jackson's description leave,
but they irritably brushed you off and returned to work.  Wilhelmina
investigated the possibility of climbing down to the fire escape
outside Jackoson's room from the floor above.  Jason Steele picked the
lock.

Inside room 410 you found your good friend Jackson Elias, sprawled
over a large chair, eviscerated and with a symbol carved into his
forehead.  Prof. Musgrave screamed, and ran back down to the
reception.  The window was open, and the fire escape visible beyond.
Items were scattered around the room.  Dr. Crane determined that the
murder had been done recently, in the last few hours.

The room contained a telephone, and you called the police.  The
receptionist downstairs also called the police.  While waiting for the
police to arrive, you looked around, and found a few items:

- A business card for Edward Gavigan, director of the London-based
  Penhew Foundation.
- A business card for Emerson Imports, with the name "Silas N'Kwane"
  written on the back in Jackson's hand.
- A handbill for a public lecture at New York University entitled "The
  Cult of Darkness in Polynesia & The Southwest Pacific", by
  Prof. Anthony Cowley of the University of Sydney, currently a
  visiting professor at Miskatonic University.

Jason Steele got in touch with his friend Chester Sullivan, an agency
detective.  He arrived at around the same time as two police officers,
who treated him with a professional respect and let him perform his
investigation in tandem with their own.

One of the officers made a phone call to Lt. Poole, saying that the
murder was the same as the ones in the Hilton Adams case of last year.
About 45 minutes later, Lt. Poole arrived, and sent Chester Sullivan
away.  Lt. Poole asked you about your connection to Jackson Elias.  He
was satisfied by your answers, and when you asked about the Hilton
Adams case held nothing back.

A string of similar murders, where the victims all had the same symbol
carved into their forehead, had occurred last year.  Lt. Poole was
looking into the case, but had no leads.  There was no connection
between the victims: rich and poor, black and white.  Captain Robson
insisted that the case be transferred to him, which it was, and he
quickly closed the case when he found Hilton Adams at the scene of one
such murder.  Hilton Adams was convicted with only circumstantial
evidence, and Lt. Poole suspects that Captain Robson had been bribed
to shut down the case.  Given the diversity of victims, Lt. Poole
suspects that they are all people who learned too much about some
secret.

Lt. Poole gave you his contact details, and said he would be in touch
if necessary.  You then left the scene.  Wilhelmina decided to go back
to Prospero House to inform Jonah Kensington of the death; the rest of
you decided to go to Emerson Imports to ask about Silas N'Kwane.

Jonah was shocked by the revelation, and immediately contacted Carlton
Ramsey, Jackson's lawyer, to arrange an urgent meeting.  Wilhelmina
tagged along.

By the time Jonah and Wilhelmina arrived at Carlton Ramsey's office,
he had been informed by the police of Jackson's death.  After
discussing the arrangements for the funeral the next day, Carlton
turned to Wilhelmina and asked if she and Jackson's other friends
could see him after the funeral for the reading of the will.
Wilhelmina agreed, and asked if they knew anything about Jackson's
recent work; they did, but thought it best to wait until tomorrow.
Wilhelmina also asked about Prof. Anthony Cowles, but they didn't know
the man.

Wilhelmina then headed to New York University to enquire about the
lecture.

At Emerson Imports you met Arthur Emerson, who made a sour expression
when you brought up Silas N'Kwane.  He said that Silas didn't work for
him, that he was a customer who used Emerson Imports to import African
trinkets for his shop.  Something about N'Kwane made Emerson's skin
crawl; he doesn't like the man.  He gave you the address of Ju-Ju
House, N'Kwane's shop.

Ju-Ju House is a very small shop, full of African trinkets, souvenirs,
display weapons, and so on.  The aged proprietor, Silas N'Kwane, said
he didn't know a Jackson Elias.  You determined that he wasn't being
entirely truthful, but he persisted in his claim.  He suggested that
maybe Jackson Elias had got his name from Mr. Emerson, but had never
come to the shop.  To get on his good side, Prof. Musgrave bought a
wooden animal, which seemed to improve Silas' opinion of you.

You then all headed to New York University as well.

At the university, you all reunited at the reception.  The lecture was
last week, and Prof. Cowles had since returned to Arkham.  You then
went to the anthropology department, on the hunch that if anyone
attended a talk about cults it was probably them, and Jason Steele
stopped people until he found a timid graduate student willing to
summarise the lecture.

The lecture was about the Cult of the Sand Bat, once widespread
amongst Australian Aborigines.  This cult worshipped a being known as
the Sand Bat, or the Father of All Bats, and partook in human
sacrifice.  They believed that by sacrificing, they would become
worthy for their god, who would appear to the world and conquer it,
turning it into a paradise for the cult.  There was also a legend that
the Sand Bat had a battle with the Rainbow Snake, another aboriginal
god---the deification of water and life---who tricked the Sand Bat,
and sealed it and all his clan in a watery place from which the Sand
Bat cannot escape.

The following morning you saw an article in the New York Times about
the similarity of Jackson Elias' murder and the crimes for which
Hilton Adams had been arrested, who was at this time on death row.
The author was Rebecca Shosenburg.

In the afternoon you went to the funeral.  It was a brief,
non-denominational, and poorly attended ceremony.  Only you, the
priest, Carlton Ramsey, his niece, and Jonah Kensington were there.
Outside the cemetery, some reporters watched.  After the ceremony
concluded, you left with Carlton to go to his office.  As you walked
by the reporters, one pushed to the front and introduced herself as
Rebecca Shosenburg, asking if you had any opinions on the similarity
of this murder to the Hilton Adams case.  You brushed her off and
continued to the office.

At the office, Carlton offered you some bootleg bourbon before the
reading of the will.  He said that Jackson had been by the day before
his death to update his will.  Jackson hadn't said anything, but
Carlton believed that Jackson was afraid, and wanted to prepare for
the worst.

The key points of the will are: that Elias has given full power of
attorney to Carlton, with complete authority to liquidate his assets;
that Carlton is to use these assets to create and manage a fund to
continue Jackson's investigation; and that you, named in the will, are
the preferred people to carry on this investigation.  Carlton is also
to act as a central point of contact, and a recruiter if people with
specialised skills, or new investigators, are required.

Jackson left a note, to be read in the event of his death, which
encouraged you to continue his investigation and find his killers.
Jackson had also left some of his papers:

- A letter, dated 1919 and sent from Cairo, from a M. Warren Besart to
  Roger Carlyle.
- A blurry photograph showing some boats in the foreground and
  buildings in the background.
- A letter to Jackson Elias from Miriam Atwright at the Harvard
  University Library.

You all agreed to join the quest and continue in Jackson's footsteps.

---

It is now the morning of the 17th of January, two days after the
murder of Jackson Elias.

You have a few leads.  Also, Carlton Ramsey mentioned that Jonah
Kensington has some of Jackson's notes, which he might be willing to
share with you.  What are you up to?


America session 2, 2018-12-08
-----------------------------

You visited Prospero House to ask Jonah Kensington for Jackson Elias'
book notes.  There was a letter, sent from Nairobi, saying that while
the authorities denied the cult aspect of the Carlyle massacre, the
locals thought differently.  With the letter was a bundle of notes.
The notes revealed that the bodies had been found in an area shunned
by the local tribes, who said it was cursed by the God of the Black
Wind, revered by the Cult of the Bloody Tongue.  The bodies had been
torn apart and, contrary to the official report, only included the
Kenyan bearers from the Carlyle party.

Jason Steele noticed that Jonah held back some papers, and persuaded
him to share them.  More notes by Jackson, but in messy handwriting
and very rambling.  These notes talked about dreams---"dreams like
Carlyle's?"---and say that "many names, many forms" are all working
towards one end, to "open the gate".  The notes also say "the books
are in Carlyle's safe..."

You then used Jonah's office phone to make some calls.  Firstly you
rang Miskatonic University, hoping to talk to Prof. Cowles about his
recent lecture.  He was unavailable, but you arranged for the
receptionist to contact Carlton Ramsey when she knew when Prof. Cowles
would be available to talk.  You also rang Harvard University Library
to talk with Miriam Atwright, about the book Jackson was looking for.
The book disappeared from the library, leaving behind only a terrible
smell of decay, and the police haven't found any leads yet.

You then decided to investigate the principals of the Carlyle
Expedition.

Dr. Crane went to the archives of the New York City Medical Affairs
Board, and managed to talk his way by the security guard.  He found
Dr. Robert Huston's notes about Roger Carlyle.  The notes say that
Roger was referred by his sister, Erica, to discuss his dreams.

Roger dreams of being called by a voice through the mist.  He follows
the voice, and finds a tall dark man with an inverted ankh blazing
upon his forehead.  The man reveals his palms, Roger's face is in one,
a misshapen pyramid is in the other.  The hands are brought together,
and Roger finds himself propelled into space.  He sees an array of
monstrous creatures, all circling a ball of energy which Roger
recognises as another aspect of the calling man.  Roger is drawn into
the ball, and a misshapen triangle appears in the void.  The creatures
rush into the triangle as the voice says "and become with me a god"
and Roger awakes.  Roger has no waking interest in anything Egyptian.
He also does not consider this a nightmare, and that he feels it is a
genuine calling.

Notes about later sessions are briefer.  Roger talks about someone
called M'Weru, who he calls "my priestess" and devotes himself to.  In
the final session, Huston says "if I do not go, C. threatens
exposure."

You decided to pay a visit to the Carlyle mansion, which lies to the
north of New York City.  You parked the car out of sight and peeked
in: a tall three-storey building with acres of surrounding grounds,
and a tall fence with a single guarded entrance.  You decided not to
try to sneak in and rob the safe.

The next morning you visited Hilton Adams, arrested for the previous
murders, in Sing Sing Prison.  You got half an hour to speak with him.

Hilton Adams was a community leader of sorts, who grew concerned with
the murders and decided to take matters into his own hands.  He found
that the murders fanned out in a rough circle for about a mile west of
the Harlem River; but none within a two block radius of West 137th
Street, between Lenox Avenue and the Harlem
River[^america3_1]---except the one which had him arrested.  A
Dr. Mordecai Lemming had been quoted in the papers saying the murders
seemed similar to those conducted by the Cult of the Bloody Tongue, an
African death cult.  As Ju-Ju House is the only thing African in the
vicinity, Hilton staked it out.  One day he managed to follow a
muscular, shaven, African man in his late 30s from Ju-Ju House to a
coffee shop on 139th Street and Sixth Avenue.  Nobody seemed keen to
talk about this man, just saying that he was Mukunga M'Dari, and he
was bad news.  Shortly after that, Hilton's knife was found at the
scene of a murder, on a night Hilton had gone out patrolling.  This
caused his arrest.  But that night Hilton says he went out with his
gun.

[^america3_1]: This is roughly the same location as the Ju-Ju House,
  which you previously visited.  Ju-Ju House is at 1 Ransom Court,
  down an alley off West 137th Street, east of Lenox Avenue.

When you returned from Sing Sing, you managed to get a phone call with
Prof. Cowles, who gave you a full summary of his lecture.  The
graduate student you talked to previously covered most of it,
Prof. Cowles additionally described some photos from his slides: each
of sweating men standing beside enormous blocks of stone, pitted and
eroded, but clearly formed for architectural purposes.  Cowles says
that the discovered, a Arthur MacWhirr of Port Hedland, Australia,
kept a diary in which he recorded several attacks on the party by
Aboriginals, and records deaths to victims from hundreds of small
punctures, reminiscent of the bat cult.

You then wanted to learn some more about Erica Carlyle, so you went to
the New York Public Library to look through its newspaper archives.
Outside, you bought today's newspaper, and found mention that the
Carlyle munitions business had become the biggest in the state, due to
the careful management of Erica Carlyle and her lawyer, Bradley Grey.
Grey is a partner in one of the top law firms in New York, but was
described as almost a personal assistant to Erica.

After debating a few ways of getting in touch with Erica Carlyle and
being invited into the mansion, you decided to send her a letter
saying that you were reopening the investigation into her brother
Roger and his ill-fated expedition.

You then went into the newspaper archives to try to find out some
information about Hypatia Masters, as there seemed no obvious reason
why a socialite would go on the expedition.  You found a mention, some
months before the expedition, that she and Roger had begun dating.

---

It is now the 22nd of January, and you have a reply to your letter.


America session 3, 2019-01-19
-----------------------------

You received a rather cold reply from Bradley Grey to your letter to
Erica Carlyle about re-opening the investigation into the Carlyle
Expedition.  He made it clear that you would have to convince him
there was some merit to your investigation before he would arrange a
meeting with Erica.  You got in touch with Bradley Grey's assistant to
arrange a meeting.  He had thought you might, and left a spot free in
his calendar the next day.

At the meeting, Jason Steele (everyone but Wilhelmina attended), tried
to convince Bradley Grey by explaining how Jackson Elias had been
looking into the Carlyle Expedition when he was murdered.  Bradley
Grey was initially unconvinced, but was impressed enough by
Prof. Musgrave's credentials to accept that you probably weren't just
trying to make some money off of the Carlyle family.  He arranged a
meeting with Erica and also told you a little about the Carlyle
Expedition principles:

- Roger Carlyle had a poor reputation amongst the investors, and the
  company's fortunes have picked up since Erica took over.
- Hypatia Masters was a socialite from a wealthy family who dated
  Roger, she was known amongst amateur circles as a skilled
  photographer.
- Jack "Brass" Brady, Roger's bodyguard and manservant, was a
  condemned man saved by Roger's lawyers, who became incredibly
  devoted and loyal to his saviour.
- He only knew Sir Aubrey Penhew by reputation, and that Dr. Robert
  Huston was a psychoanalysist favoured by Erica Carlyle.

Two days later (the 25th), you returned to the Carlyle estate, this
time not hiding your car behind a hill, and were ushered into a
reception hall to meet Erica Carlyle.  After introductions, she led
you to a sitting room and you talked about Roger.

She told you that Roger had been having bad dreams for several months
before the expedition, waking screaming.  He refused to discuss these
dreams, and eventually Erica referred him to Dr. Huston.  A month or
so after the dreams began, Roger became involved with "that Negro
woman, Bunay".  Erica doesn't know who this Bunay is, but Roger became
increasingly obsessed with her, describing her as "queenly", and "a
priestess".  Roger began to disappear for days at a time, saying only
that he had been to Harlem on his return.  Bunay had accompanied the
expedition.

You then asked about the books in the safe.  Erica was unable to hide
her surprise, saying that Roger had spent a lot of time pouring over
old books in the months leading up to the expedition.  Roger had hid
the books in a safe, and not even told Erica about them, so she was
surprised that you knew.  You convinced her to show you the books, and
she summoned a guard and took you to the library.

You waited outside while she fetched the books.  When you went in,
there were four books arranged on a table, and no sign of a safe.  The
books were:

- *The Pnakotic Manuscripts*, centuries old and written in English.
- *Selections de Livre D'Ivon*, centuries old and written in a
  language none of you recognised (French).
- *Amongst the Stones*, fairly recent, English, handwritten, and bound
  in some sort of skin.
- *Life As A God*, fairly recent, English, and bound in human skin.

Over the next few hours Prof. Musgrave read *Amongst the Stones* and
Lady Ashdown read *Life As A God* (after Wilhelmina tried and failed).
*Amongst the Stones* is a collection of poetry, and one stood out.  It
was about the regal garments of Queen Nitocris of Egypt, in great
detail.  *Life As A God* is the diary of English artist Montgomery
Crompton, who went to Egypt in 1805 and became a priest of the
Brotherhood of the Black Pharaoh.  Crompton was insane when he wrote
the diary.  It describes unspeakable acts committed in the name of the
Black Pharaoh, and the hidden throne room of Bent Pyramid.

By the time you finished reading, Erica Carlyle had left, and the
guard politely suggested that you would be overstaying your welcome if
you remained any longer.  You took the hint and left.

The next day Jason Steele decided to stake out Ju-Ju House, and
Wilhelmina the cafe mentioned by Hilton Adams.  In the mid-morning,
Jason saw a white man poorly concealing a gun beneath his jacket enter
the Ju-Ju House.  The man left a few minutes later stuffing an
envelope into his inside pocket.  Jason followed the man to a nearby
police station, and watched for a while, but the man did not come out.
Jason peered through the windows, and was seen; but managed to outrun
the police.  The only thing of note to happen at the cafe is that
Silas N'Kwane, owner of Ju-Ju House, went for lunch.

The next day you continued your stake-outs.  In mid-afternoon, a man
matching Mukunga M'Dari's description paid a short visit to the Ju-Ju
House, and then headed in the direction of the cafe.  Jason followed.
The man arrived at the cafe, and a few minutes later Jason also
entered.  Jason got the attention of Wilhelmina and indicated to
Mukunga M'Dari.  Mukunga spoke quietly to a waiter, and was led
through a door.

Wilhelmina got the attention of a waiter and asked what was through
the door.  The waiter judged that she was not with the police, and
seemed a trustworthy sort, so he told her that it is the door to a
speakeasy.  Wilhelmina went through the door, which took her to a
staircase leading down to the basement.

At this time of day the speakeasy was not particularly busy, but it
had a fair few customers.  Mukunga M'Dari was sitting by himself with
his drink.  Wilhelmina asked the bartender who he (Mukunga) was, and
learned that he has a bad reputation.  He has no apparent employment,
but always has money; he seems to be friendly with the police; and
people don't like to mess with him.  Wilhelmina finished her drink and
left, collecting Jason from the cafe.

---

It is now the 26th of January.  What are you doing?


America session 4, 2019-02-10
-----------------------------

You decided to break in to the Ju-Ju House[^america4_1], so Jason and
Wilhelmina arrived around closing time and watched the shop for a few
hours.  A little after midnight, a light was still on inside, though
the curtains were drawn across the shop window so you couldn't see in.
Jason peered through the keyhole, and saw Silas N'Kwane bent over
something behind the counter.

[^america4_1]: Because I mentioned that I assumed were going to do
  that, and you all thought it was a reasonable enough idea.

Wilhelmina found a back door down an alley, and Jason picked the lock.
You cautiously entered a small dark room, separated from the shopfront
by a thick curtain, and which looked like Silas N'Kwane's living
quarters.  Wilhelmina looked through the curtain and saw Silas opening
a trap door behind the counter.  He heard the curtain move and looked
up, but did not see Wilhelmina.  He entered the back room, but Jason
managed to hide in a closet in time.  Wilhelmina lead Silas out of the
back door, giving Jason enough time to enter the shopfront, and
descend the stairs beneath the open trap door.

Jason entered a large basement, running under the entire building.  At
one end was a large well with a stone cover, about 2 metres in
diameter.  Half way along the wall opposite the entrance was a curtain
covering an alcove.  It was completely silent.

Jason approached the curtain, and peered beneath it.  Inside the
alcove were four pairs of standing bare feet, two along the wall to
the left and two along the wall to the right.  These looked like the
feet of living people, rather than a statue or something like that,
but still there was no noise.

Jason slowly and quietly got to his feet, grasped the curtain in one
hand and a camera in the other.  He dramatically whisked the curtain
aside, to reveal four people, their foreheads branded with the same
symbol as Jackson Elias, their intestines spilling out of open wounds,
their skin decaying, and their eyes completely black.  Their heads
snapped to the side to look at Jason, who took a photo and ran.  They
leaped after him, but he got to the stairs, and they would not follow
out of the basement.

Jason climbed the stairs, to be faced with Silas N'Kwane.  Jason
managed to shove him out of the way, climbed over the counter, and
jumped through the front window, being wounded a little by broken
glass in the process.  Wilhelmina had brought the car around, and they
escaped to Jason's office.  Jason developed the photo in his darkroom,
pacing impatiently while waiting for it to process.  In the early
morning, the photo was ready.  Jason called everyone around, along
with Lt. Poole, who came to investigate Jackson Elias' murder, and
shared the photo.

Lt. Poole shakily asked where the photo was taken, and commented that
that was Captain Robson's territory.  Captain Robson is the one who
arrested Hilton Adams for the previous murders.  Lt. Poole called a
squad of officers to go visit the Ju-Ju House.

You all, except Wilhelmina who was still sleeping, arrived at the
Ju-Ju House with police backup.  Lt. Poole took command of the
situation, taking Silas N'Kwane into custody and demanding access to
the basement.  Silas looked surprised and briefly annoyed---as if he
didn't expect the police, of all people, to do this---before changing
his demeanour to meek submission.  The trap door was revealed beneath
a rug, and you all descended.  Prof. Musgrave stayed outside, due to
his ballistophobia.

In the basement was Mukunga M'Dari, surrounded by the four people.
Several of you gasped at the sight.  Dr. Crane attempted to
rationalise the situation by saying that they must be victims of
torture, probably drugged which is why they can stand and move around
at all with those wounds, but others were less convinced.  Lt. Poole
shouted for everyone to put their hands where he could see them and
not to make any sudden moves.  Mukunga complied, the four didn't move.

One of the officers approached the four, and put his hand on their
shoulder to guide them down to the floor.  As soon as he made physical
contact, the person spun around and snapped the officer's arm in two
with incredible speed.  The other three adopted fighting postures, and
all moved between Mukunga and the police.  The wounded man passed out
due to the pain and was carried to the back of the room, where
Dr. Crane treated him.  Dr. Crane and Clarissa carried him out while
the police opened fire.  The four people seemed unaffected by the
bullets, being knocked back but otherwise not appearing to suffer from
the onslaught.  They shielded Mukunga, who was hiding behind them
still.

Jason realised he still had some dynamite[^america4_2], and decided to
use it.  He threw it, but fumbled his grip a little, and hit one of
the officers.  The dynamite fell in the middle of the room.  You and
all but one of the police managed to escape from the basement before
it exploded.

[^america4_2]: From Peru.

As the explosion ripped through the basement, there was suddenly a
sound of dozens of voices---far more than there had been in the
basement---wailing in agony.  Jason and Dr. Crane returned to the
basement and cautiously entered.  Mukunga and the four people had been
torn apart by the dynamite.  The stone seal over the well had been
cracked open, and the noise was coming from there.  Thinking it might
be more torture victims, Dr. Crane approached.

In the well Dr. Crane saw a great writhing mass of tentacles, or
perhaps worms, covered in screaming human faces.  In a bout of
madness, he threw up and ran, screaming, from the basement.  He made
it past the surprised officers in the shopfront, and was only caught
outside.  Seeing what had happened, Jason decided not to approach the
well.

Jason investigated the alcove, as the photo he took showed a
bulky-looking bag, and found:

- A cloth headdress with a severed human tongue attached to the front.

- A robe made of feathers.

- The book *Africa's Dark Sects*, which Jackson Elias was looking for
  at Harvard University Library.  The book details Nigel Blackwell's
  travels across Africa and the cults he encountered on the way,
  including a description in great detail of a cult summoning the
  monster they worship.  It contains one spell, and will take several
  weeks to study fully.

- A woven wooden mask, like a woven basket, but with no eyeholes.  On
  the top of the mask are four monstrous faces, at right angles to
  each other.  Prof. Musgrave identified the mask being possibly from
  the Congo.

- A wooden sceptre carved with hieroglyphics saying "Nyambe, Thy Power
  Mine".  From the context, Nyambe is a given name, but not one any of
  you are familiar with.

- A marine chronometer, a very accurate clock used by sailors to
  calculate their position.  It was set to GMT, rather than local
  time.

Jason managed to persuade Lt. Poole that there was enough evidence
left at the Ju-Ju House for him to conduct an investigation, and to
overturn the conviction of Hilton Adams, and he allowed you to take
the items from the alcove.

Having exhausted the trail in New York, you decided to follow an
earlier lead to the Penhew Foundation, and set sail for London.  The
crossing took 9 days, during which you attempted to rest and to
recover some of your sanity.

---

It is now the 5th of February, and you have just arrived in
London. Where are you staying and what are you doing?


England intro, 2019-03-16
-------------------------

It's been nine uneventful days at sea since you departed New York, and
now Southampton is in sight.  From there you can catch a train to
London, at the time the heart of the British Empire, the greatest city
in the world, and famous for its incredibly thick fogs.

You came to London following two leads:

- The Carlyle Expedition, which briefly stopped over in London and
  picked up the Egyptologist Sir Aubrey Penhew, founder of the Penhew
  Foundation.

- And Jackson Elias, who had a business card for Edward Gavigan, the
  current director of the Penhew Foundation, in his hotel room.

Before we get into the game, I'd like to bring up some mechanics, and
also talk about some backstories.

Firstly, Dr. Carson Crane is indefinitely insane.  This means that
losing even one point of sanity will cause him to suffer a bout of
madness, and also he can have sensory hallucinations at any time.  You
can take sanity damage from hallucinating a mythos creature.  Luke, if
you think Dr. Crane is hallucinating, there are two things you can do:

- You can make a Reality Check roll, which is a Sanity roll.  If you
  succeed you see through the delusion, and can't have any more until
  you take some sanity damage.  If you fail, you take one point of
  sanity damage and suffer a bout of madness.

- Or you can make a Psychoanalysis roll.  If you succeed, you see
  through the delusion.

The only way to recover from indefinite insanity is to spend months in
an asylum recuperating.

Secondly, there's a mechanic I forgot about.  If an investigator
suffers insanity from a mythos source, they gain one point of Cthulhu
Mythos, or five points the first time.  I've given you all an extra
eight points of Cthulhu Mythos, which probably covers it.

Now, backstories.

Lady Clarissa Ashdown, it's a bit unusual to be a Lady in your own
right at such a young age.  Normally your mother would be "Lady
Ashdown" by virtue of being married to your father, Lord Ashdown.  Are
you actually a lady, or do you just call yourself that because you
have noble parents?  What's your family situation like?[^england0_1]

[^england0_1]: Possible follow ups depending on the answer: Is Lord
  Ashdown a member of the House of Lords?  Where are the Ashdowns
  based?

Professor Musgrave, you must know of the Penhew Foundation, unless
you've spent your entire academic career under a rock.  You certainly
know that it was established in 1890 by Sir Aubrey Penhew who, as
director of the Foundation, funded and oversaw several expeditions to
Egypt.  When Sir Aubrey was presumed dead after the massacre of the
Carlyle Expedition, Edward Gavigan became director.  The Foundation
issues grants to scholars undertaking the study of Egyptian history
and antiquities.  It also helps out with planning and funding
expeditions, negotiating permits with Egyptian authorities, hiring
local labour, et cetera.  The Foundation building itself is partly
offices, partly museum.  Have you been on an expedition supported by
the Penhew Foundation?[^england0_2]

[^england0_2]: Possible follow up depending on the answer: Do you have
  a research membership to the Penhew Foundation?

Now, before you all disembark, there's one more thing.  Firearms are
illegal in England at this time unless you have a permit, except
shotguns which are considered weapons for hunting game.  Everyone who
is bringing a gun into the country make a Luck roll now.


England session 1, 2019-03-16
-----------------------------

### 9th of February, 1925

You arrived in Southampton, ready to begin the next leg of your
adventure.

Prof Musgrave, who has had dealings with the Penhew Foundation and
Edward Gavigan before, rang the Foundation to arrange an interview.
Thomas Kinnery, Edward Gavigan's personal secretary, arranged a
meeting for the following day, in the late morning.

You then hopped aboard a train, which took you to London in about six
hours.  You spent the rest of the day sorting out your accommodation,
finding a regular meeting place to discuss the events of each day, and
planning the next day.

### 10th of February, 1925

Wilhelmina decided not to accompany you to the interview with Edward
Gavigan, and went to look through newspaper archives for any new
information relating to the Carlyle Expedition.

The rest of you went to the Penhew Foundation and were greeted by
Thomas Kinnery.  He took you to an anteroom outside Edward Gavigan's
office, where you took seats, and he returned to work.  Jason Steele
got up to examine the room, which was decorated with Egyptian scrolls,
and some information about the Foundation's previous expeditions.

After a few minutes, Edward Gavigan emerged from his office, and
greeted Prof. Musgrave like an old friend before ushering you all in.
The office itself was quite bare, there were chairs, a desk with a
photo facing away from you, a cupboard against one wall, and a floor
safe in one corner of the room, its door ajar.

Prof. Musgrave trusts Edward Gavigan, and so told him the story so far
(if a little abridged when it came to the more unbelievable
components).  Gavigan confirmed that Jackson Elias, "that journalist
working for The Scoop"[^feb10_scoop], had come to visit him and ask
some questions about the work of the Foundation.  Gavigan had been
pleased to talk about the Foundation's role in grant funding and
assistance with travel permits and the like.  It had been a short
meeting, and he had never heard from Jackson Elias again.

[^feb10_scoop]: You have never heard of The Scoop before, and Jackson
  Elias was not a journalist.  You guessed that this is probably a
  cover story Jackson gave.

You then asked about the Carlyle Expedition.  Gavigan said that Roger
Carlyle had obtained information from "an African woman" about a
shadowy time in Egyptian history where the Nile had been ruled by a
sorcerer.  Sir Aubrey had been interested in this period as well.
Unfortunately, the information turned out to be a hoax, and after
conducting some digs in Egypt, the African woman took off with the
money (some £3500).  The loss of the money bothered Carlyle less than
the defection of his lover, and the party went to Kenya to distract
themselves with hunting and wildlife photography.  There they strayed
into unfortunate territory, and paid for it with their lives.  Sir
Aubrey had kept in touch with the Foundation during the expedition,
even sending some artefacts back before they left for Kenya, but
Gavigan would not show you these telegraphs, saying that they
concerned much of young Carlyle and were of a personal nature, not the
sort of thing which the Foundation could afford "getting into the
gutter press."

Gavigan then showed you some of the artefacts in the exhibition hall,
which Prof. Musgrave greatly enjoyed, but the rest of you less so.
While showing the artefacts, Jason Steele returned to Gavigan's
office, with the excuse that he left his hat behind.  Without much
time to spare, to avoid rousing the suspicions of Kinnery, Jason
quickly looked at the photograph on the desk and in the floor safe.

The photograph was of a three storey country house called "Misr
House".  Upon being told this later, Prof. Musgrave recognised "Misr"
as being Arabic for "Egypt".  The safe contained roughly a hundred £1
notes.

Musgrave spent the rest of the afternoon enjoying the Penhew
Foundation's library, where he found a book mentioning the "Black
Pharaoh", a figure of myth who is said to have ruled during the Third
Dynasty.

While this was going on, Wilhelmina spent the entire day in the
newspaper archives, finding nothing new about the Carlyle Expedition,
but finding an article by The Scoop on the "Egyptian Murders" from
right before Jackson Elias was in London.  The article describes a
series of murders with the victims all severely beaten and stabbed
through the heart.

You then reconvened, and decided the next day to check out The Scoop
and Misr House.

### 11th of February, 1925

Prof. Musgrave decided to go with Jason Steele to investigate Misr
House, mostly to keep an eye on Jason, because he didn't want the man
he introduced to Edward Gavigan as a friend, to be found the next day
breaking into Gavigan's country estate.  You both went to the General
Records Office and found that Misr House was located on a 1000 acre
estate on an island in the Naze, in Essex.  You got on a train to
Colchester, intending to change to a local train to
Walton-on-the-Naze, and hire a car from there.

The rest of you went to the offices of The Scoop, located on the third
floor of a grubby building on Fleet Street.  Mention of Jackson Elias
got you to Mickey Mahoney, owner and editor of The Scoop.  He said he
was a friend of Jackson's, and that any friend of Jackson is a friend
of his.  He said that Jackson had been investigating a cult in the
heart of London, but Jackson hadn't told him the details; he would pay
£15 for the story if you bring it to him.  He also said that Jackson
had been interested in three stories The Scoop had printed (the
Egyptian Murders was one), but he couldn't remember the titles of the
other two off the top of his head, and that you were welcome to look
through the back issues to try to find them.  He didn't know of
anything suspicious about the Carlyle Expedition.

After a couple of hours of finding likely looking articles and asking
"is this one?" you finally found the two others that Jackson Elias had
been interested in:

- **Slaughter Continues!  Reward Offered!** - the Egyptian Murders, a
  series of murders in which all the victims had been killed by severe
  beating, and then stabbed through the heart.  Inspector Barrington
  at New Scotland Yard has been investigating, and Mahoney said that
  Jackson Elias had gone to visit him.

- **Shocking Canvases Craze: Local Artist's Monstrous Scenes Mock
  'Surrealists'** - Miles Shipley, a local artist, has been painting
  very realistic scenes of horror, which are said to be visions of
  another place the artist merely makes visible.

- **Police Baffled By Monstrous Murders!  Killer Beast Shot But Still
  Alive?** - two murders and one wounding in Lesser Edale, Derbyshire,
  which have been attributed to a rabid dog.  Despite the dog being
  shot dead, local residents report a strange beast lurking in the
  area which wails on nights of the full moon.

In the afternoon, Prof. Musgrave and Jason arrive at the island of
Misr House, but are turned away by a guard at the one bridge onto the
island.  He says that this is private property owned by Edward
Gavigan, and you cannot come in.  From the bridge you could see Misr
House, but not much else on the island due to the heavy forestation.
Prof. Musgrave seemed a little smug, asking Jason if he was satisfied
now.  You returned to the village to try to gather some information
about the estate.

In the village pub the landlord, after being encouraged to pour a
third drink "for yourself", told you some of the history of the area.
The land and house had previously been owned by an Egyptologist and
occultist Neville Lloyd-Price.  Rumour has it that he went bankrupt
and had to sell the land to pay his debts, Edward Gavigan was the
buyer.  Neville Lloyd-Price has not been seen since the sale,
effectively disappearing from London society.  The house dates from
the time of Queen Elizabeth, and is rumoured to have a priest hole,
used to hide Catholic priests during the religious purges.  The estate
itself is 6000 acres, with the island being 1000.  The surrounding
land is rented out to farmers.  Edward Gavigan doesn't show himself
much, he visits the house occasionally but it doesn't seem to be his
primary residence.  Everyone knows of him as the land owner, but he is
a fairly distant figure.  You then decided to return to London and
meet up with the others in the evening.

The rest of you decided to visit Miles Shipley, the artist, at his
home in Holbein Mews.  You were greeted at the door by an old woman
who introduced herself as Bertha Shipley, Miles' mother.  Upon saying
you were interested in buying some paintings, she took you in to a
sitting room, and called for Miles while she made some tea.  As soon
as you stepped into the house you were struck with a strong biological
smell, which Wilhelmina recognised as the smell of a reptile house.
Upon asking Bertha about it, she seemed embarrassed that you had
noticed, as if she had not realised how strong it was, and said that
she was looking after a friend's reptiles while they were away.

After a few minutes, you heard Miles clattering down the stairs, and
he entered the room.  A quiet and nervous looking young man, you
spotted that his hands were shaking.  He invited you up to the garret
to see the finished paintings.  He took the lead, Dr. Crane, Clarissa,
and Wilhelmina following, and Bertha Shipley bringing up the rear
carrying teacups.  In the garret room you noticed that Miles glanced
over at Bertha, who seemed completely calm, and in charge of the
situation.  She said that the paintings were £75 to £300 each.  The
paintings were:

- **Ancient Science** - an alchemical lab with a reptilian humanoid
  working at a table surrounded by glass jars emitting colourful
  vapours.

- **The Dark Pharaoh** - a processional scene in which a mass of
  people prostrate themselves before a golden chariot.  Standing atop
  the chariot is a pharaoh in black and gold robes, his face turned
  away from the canvas.  Behind the pharaoh, two men have been impaled
  on stakes, and are being eaten by a pack of jackals.

- **Goat Wood** - a nighttime woodland scene illuminated by a yellow
  moon, naked men and women dancing around a bonfire.  Rising from the
  flames is a goat-headed man with outstretched arms.

- **Drawn in Blood** - a man being cut open by a silver dagger, with
  an occult symbol carved into his chest which you can't quite seem to
  focus on.

- **Black Mountain** - a towering mountain over which rises a
  monstrous demonic creature, its head a great tentacle covered in
  blood[^feb11_bm1].  In a nearby temple-like building, small human
  figures wearing a headdress with a red tentacle[^feb11_bm2] lift
  their arms towards it in supplication.

[^feb11_bm1]: This reminds you of the tattoo on Larkin's chest of the
  man with a spiral emerging from his neck in place of a head.

[^feb11_bm2]: These look like Mukunga M'Dari's headdress you found at
  the Ju-Ju House.

Miles also showed you a painting he is working on entitled **City of
the Great Race**, which depicted tiny human figures next to a colossal
building, but it was still in early stages.  You examined the
paintings themselves, and the art supplies in the room; everything
looked ordinary, other than the subject matter of the paintings.  When
asked about the newspaper article saying that Miles was painting
visions, Bertha said that the newspapers exaggerate everything, which
Miles agreed with.

You pick out **The Dark Pharaoh**, **Drawn in Blood**, and **Black
Mountain** as paintings you would like to buy, and leave to go to the
bank.

While out of the house, you formulated a plan: Clarissa and Dr. Crane
would distract the Shipleys by haggling, while Wilhelmina would sneak
out of the garret and examine the rest of the house.  When you
returned, you put the plan into action, and Wilhelmina slipped out of
the room.

On the first floor, there are four bedrooms.  Three were open and very
dusty, as if they hadn't been used in a long time.  One was locked,
but through the keyhole Wilhelmina could see it looked messy and in
active use.

On the ground floor, in addition to the corridor, stairs, and sitting
room you had seen, there is also a kitchen (which looked normal), and
a dining room and lounge, both of which looked dusty and unused.
There was no sign of reptiles, beyond the pervasive smell.  In the
garden was a locked cellar door which Wilhelmina could not pick.
Wilhelmina quietly returned to the garret, where the Shipleys were
still distracted.  You then exchanged the money, and left with your
paintings.

As you left the house, Wilhelmina asked what reptiles Bertha was
caring for.  Bertha looked momentarily confused, as if she had
forgotten about the reptiles, and then said snakes.
