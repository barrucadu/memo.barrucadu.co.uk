Masks of Nyarlathotep is a campaign for Call of Cthulhu.  We're
playing the new edition for CoC 7e.  These are the tales of our
investigations.


Player characters
-----------------

* **Clarissa Ashdown** (23), an antiquarian from England.  Calls
  herself "Lady Ashdown", but is actually heiress to that title.

* **Wilhelmina Braun** (26), a drifter from Austria.  Lived on the
  streets of Lima, then moved to New York to work for Prospero House
  following the events in Peru.

* **Dr. Carson Crane** (34), a doctor of medicine from Louisiana.
  Indefinitely insane: prone to sensory delusions and bouts of
  madness.  Suffering from myxophobia, the fear of slime.

* **Professor Arthur Musgrave** (62), an archaeologist from London.
  Suffering from ballistophobia, the fear of guns and bullets.

* **Jason Steele** (32), a private eye from Salem.  Not insane, but
  seems to be a bit paranoid nonetheless.

These ages and descriptions reflect the characters as they currently
are, not as they were at the beginning of the campaign.


Notable possessions
-------------------

### Found in Peru

- Wilhelmina's rusty bike, which she found on the streets of Lima one
  day.

- A golden mirror, found in Peru, similar in design to artefacts found
  in Tiwanaku.  Gave Prof. Musgrave a vision when he looked into it.

### Found in America

- A cloth headdress with a severed human tongue attached to the front.

- <span class="highlight">[Stolen]</span>
  A robe made of feathers.

- The book **Africa's Dark Sects**, which Jackson Elias was looking
  for at Harvard University Library.  The book details Nigel
  Blackwell's travels across Africa and the cults he encountered on
  the way, including a description in great detail of a cult summoning
  the monster they worship.  It contains one spell, and will take
  several weeks to study fully.

- <span class="highlight">[Stolen]</span>
  A woven wooden mask, like a woven basket, but with no eyeholes.  On
  the top of the mask are four monstrous faces, at right angles to
  each other.  Prof. Musgrave identified the mask being possibly from
  the Congo.

- <span class="highlight">[Stolen]</span>
  A wooden sceptre carved with hieroglyphics saying "Nyambe, Thy Power
  Mine".  From the context, Nyambe is a given name, but not one any of
  you are familiar with.

- A marine chronometer, a very accurate clock used by sailors to
  calculate their position.  It was set to GMT, rather than local
  time.

### Found in England

- Paintings by Miles Shipley:

  - **The Dark Pharaoh** - a processional scene in which a mass of
    people prostrate themselves before a golden chariot.  Standing
    atop the chariot is a pharaoh in black and gold robes, his face
    turned away from the canvas.  Behind the pharaoh, two men have
    been impaled on stakes, and are being eaten by a pack of jackals.

  - **Drawn in Blood** - a man being cut open by a silver dagger, with
    an occult symbol carved into his chest which you can't quite seem
    to focus on.

  - **Black Mountain** - a towering mountain over which rises a
    monstrous demonic creature, its head a great tentacle covered in
    blood.  In a nearby temple-like building, small human figures
    wearing a headdress with a red tentacle lift their arms towards it
    in supplication.

  - A hyper-realistic, unfinished, painting of a swampy landscape in
    the Permian era, featuring humanoid lizards.  The figures in the
    painting seem to move purposefully when you look at it.

- A greenish hallucinogenic drug which provokes mythos visions.

### Found in China

- A gross statuette of a bloated, tentacled, woman.

- A strange and intricate mechanism.

- A bunch of voluminous black and yellow robes.

- The book **True Magick** (1700s, English).  Details the nature and
  habits of "demonic creatures", including the means to summon them.
  Also discusses the author's interpretation of the different schools
  of magic.

- Some ancient scrolls written in Chinese.  Currently with Mr. Lung.


Peru session 1, 2018-09-29
--------------------------

### 18th of March, 1921

You all responded to a newspaper advert looking for participants in an
expedition to find an unknown pyramid in Peru, organised by one
Augustus Larkin.

In Lima, Peru, you met Augustus Larkin, a sickly looking white man
with a British accent, who you noticed is possibly suffering opioid
withdrawal symptoms; Luis de Mendoza, a Hispanic-looking man, who is
Larkin's silent and imposing assistant; and Jesse Hughes, an
African-American folklorist.  "Jesse Hughes" is actually an alias he
has given Larkin, his real identity is Jackson Elias, a not-unknown
author who investigates and writes about real-world cults.

Over dinner, Larkin gave you an overview of the expedition and what he
hopes to find.  Afterwards, Jackson Elias revealed that he has doubts:
he's in Peru to investigate an ancient death cult behind the legend of
the "kharisiri", fat-sucking vampires.  Mendoza has a fearsome
reputation, and Larkin is acting strangely; Jackson Elias thinks that
they, the pyramid, and this expedition are all connected to the cult
somehow.

You, and Jackson Elias, are staying in the Hotel Maury; Larkin and
Mendoza are staying in the Hotel Espana.  The expedition leaves the
morning of the day after tomorrow to Puno, and from there into the
mountains: so you have one evening and one full day in Lima.

### 19th of March, 1921

You went with Jackson Elias to meet with Professor Memesio Sanchez, a
respected archaeologist and historian at the local
university. Professor Sanchez has offered numerous times to help
Larkin's expedition, but been rebuffed or ignored every time.  He
thinks that Larkin plans to steal the pyramid's historical treasures
and take them abroad, which the law currently does not prevent.  He
and his assistant, the undergraduate Trinidad Rizo, have been
conducting research into the possible location of the pyramid, based
on documents in the university archives.

Rizo was taking an unusually long time to arrive at the meeting, so
you---not including Jackson Elias and Professor Sanchez---went to the
store room to investigate.  There you found signs of a struggle, and
Rizo's dead body.  Boxes had been knocked off shelves, and she was
partly buried.  You found the skin stretched tightly over her bones,
as if the fat had been removed from her body, and a large circular
wound in her chest.


Peru session 2, 2018-10-27
--------------------------

### 19th of March, 1921 (early afternoon)

Still reeling from the shock of finding Rizo's damaged body,
Prof. Musgrave ran back to the office to fetch Prof. Sanchez and
Jackson Elias.

Dr. Crane, as he finished his examination of the body and climbed to
his feet noticed two things previously missed: a sheet of handwritten
paper sticking out of Rizo's jacket pocket, and the glint of gold from
a crate next to her body.  You all read the paper while you waited for
Prof. Musgrave and the rest to return: it was Rizo's notes on "The
Final Confessions of Gaspar Figueroa", a conquistador who came to Peru
in 1541.  The notes describe how he and his companions---Hernando
Ruiz, Diego Garrido, Luis de Mendoza, and Pedro de Velasco---found an
ancient temple near Lake Titicaca full of gold, how they removed some
of the gold and, that night, all turned into ravenous monsters who
pursued Figueroa.  Figueroa eventually arrived in Lima, wasted and
weakened by his ordeal, still carrying the gold they removed.  For the
rest of his days, Figueroa was plagued by hearing the voices of his
friends, crying out in inhuman hunger; and another voice, ancient and
seductive, promising him eternal life if he returned to the temple.

Musgrave, Sanchez, and Elias all arrived back.  Prof. Sanchez, shocked
and grieving, collapsed to the floor next to Rizo's corpse; Lady
Ashdown examined the gold in the crate, and found it to be a solid
gold band covered in geometric shapes, with ragged edges as if it had
been torn from a larger design, and managed to get enough sense out of
Prof. Sanchez to learn that this gold was found with the Gaspar
Figueroa documents.  The crate itself looked like it had been torn
apart, rather than being damaged by simply falling to the floor as a
shelf was knocked.  Furthermore, she noticed that the gold, while cold
to the touch, had burned scraps of skin stuck to it, as if someone had
tried to pick it up while red hot.

You all argued about how best to distribute weapons amongst the party
as you pursued the presumed attacker by following the bloody
footprints, until Sanchez cried out "we have to call the *police*!"
You decided to split up: Jackson Elias and Prof. Sanchez would go back
to his office to call the police, Wilhelmina would stay here to watch
the body, and the rest of you would follow the footprints.

The footprints became harder and harder to track, and you lost them
back in the corridor leading to Prof. Sanchez's office.  In front of
you was the door outside, to your left were the offices.  Lady Ashdown
and Jason Steele went outside, Dr. Crane and Prof. Musgrave decided to
go check out the offices.  As they arrived at Prof. Sanchez's office,
Prof. Musgrave glimpsed a face peering in through the window, which
quickly disappeared.  The window looked out onto an area behind the
university building full of trees and shrubbery, with no paths and few
visitors.  You both, and Jackson Elias, climbed out of the window, but
couldn't see anyone.  Prof. Musgrave heard quiet footsteps not very
far away, as of someone trying to sneak away, and ran towards the
source.

Prof. Musgrave emerged into a clearing, to find Luis de Mendoza, who
turned slowly and fixed the professor with a silent gaze.  Dr. Crane
and Jackson Elias caught up as you stared each other down.
Prof. Musgrave drew a gun, and tried to question Mendoza: silence.
Jackson Elias tried in Spanish: silence.  Dr. Crane went to fetch the
others; after he left, Mendoza charged Prof. Musgrave, who shot him
twice without slowing him down.  Mendoza barreled into the professor,
tackling him to the ground, but got shot at point-blank range by
Jackson Elias, flinging him off, and he lay still.  Everyone but
Wilhelmina, who was still watching the body, showed up a few minutes
later.  Dr. Crane examined the body and said that no man could survive
that.  About half an hour later, the police showed up and took over.

You decided to go confront Larkin, to see what he knew about Mendoza
and, if nothing else, to tell him he needed a new bodyguard as you'd
killed his current one.  You arrived at the Hotel Espana and met the
aged proprietor, Petronila Cupitina, who directed you to Larkin and
Mendoza's rooms.  Both were silent.  After fiddling around with
lockpicks and considering scaling the exterior of the building, you
discovered Larkin's room was actually unlocked all along, and
cautiously entered.  The room was a tip, with things scattered
everywhere.  There you found Larkin, out of his mind on a large dose
of heroin, which Dr. Crane estimated would not be fatal, but which
would last several more hours.  Larkin vaguely recognised you, but was
unable to do anything more than suggest that you meet some other time.

You decided to snoop around and look for clues.  Wilhelmina
unsuccessfully tried to find a map to the pyramid.  Jackson Elias
noticed that Larkin had a large tattoo on his check: of a person, but
in the place of his head was a large spiral.  He recognised this as
the symbol of the Cult of the Bloody Tongue, a particularly violent
Kenyan cult, and had no idea what would bring them to Peru.  Under the
stench of Larkin's strong cologne, Lady Ashdown noticed the faint
smell of rotting meat.

You then broke into Mendoza's room.  In contrast to Larkin's, it was
spotlessly clean, as if it had never been used.  Again, Wilhelmina
unsuccessfully looked for a map.  Jason Steele found a small mirror of
polished gold beneath the mattress, the only personal item in the
room.  Prof. Musgrave examined it... and had a brief vision of white
tentacles bursting through a pyramid.

You decided to come back after a few hours to talk to Larkin when he
was sober again.  Prof. Musgrave went back to his hotel room to rest.
The rest of you confronted Larkin, telling him that Mendoza had killed
a girl at the university, and asking how long Mendoza had been in his
employ.  Larkin expressed shock and disbelief that Mendoza would do
such a thing, and said that he had only known Mendoza for a few
months.  Lady Ashdown realised that Larkin was lying.  Larkin seemed
to have no recollection of your visit that afternoon.

### 20th of March, 1921

You set off to Puno in the Andean foothills.  Larkin was determined
that the loss of Mendoza not slow down the expedition.  This was an
uneventful three-day journey by truck, during which you fought off
altitude sickness.

You had one night to rest in Puno before heading out the next morning
to the pyramid on foot.  Most of you chose to stay in the hotel, but
Wilhelmina decided to roam the streets.  She realised an old woman was
following her, and confronted this person.  The old woman asked if
Wilhelmina was with Larkin and, upon hearing that she was but that she
didn't trust Larkin, the woman said to follow her.  She said her name
was Nayra, and that she didn't think it was a good idea to go with
Larkin to the pyramid.  She told a local legend, of an unknown dark
god that fell from the sky into Lake Titicaca, and brought hunger and
famine with it.  One day a hero lured the god into a cave, which was
full of the most delicious tubers and grubs; and sealed the cave with
huge rocks.  A pyramid was then built over the cave, with spells
worked in gold to keep the god imprisoned forever.  Wilhelmina
wondered aloud if the god had escaped[^peru2_1], at which Nayra
crossed herself[^peru2_2] and shuddered.

[^peru2_1]: Out-of-character at this point you were discussing a few
  theories: such as if the golden band at at the university which
  Gaspar Figueroa brought from a pyramid was part of the golden seal
  used to keep the god imprisoned, and if Mendoza was some aspect or
  manifestation of this god who had escaped when the seal was broken.

[^peru2_2]: Nayra seems to follow a mixture of Catholicism and local
  beliefs.

### 21st of March, 1921

You discussed what you knew, and sent a telegram off to Prof. Sanchez
detailing your findings.  You thought that you might need to bring the
gold band to the pyramid, so it's best for him to be prepared.

You then set out into the jungle with Larkin, using pack animals to
carry your supplies.  No locals would accompany you now.  After a few
hours you stopped for lunch, and Lady Ashdown spied a majestic jaguar
in the distance.

That night around 3am, the noise of one of the pack animals in
distress alerted Dr. Crane, who was on watch, and awakened Lady
Ashdown, a light sleeper.  You found a filthy man, stinking and
dressed in rags, pinning one of the animals to the ground with his
face pressed into it.  Lady Ashdown hit the man in the head with a
crowbar, knocking him off the animal, and revealing that his mouth was
no human mouth: it was circular and full of sharp teeth, much like a
lamprey.  The rest of you had awoken at this point, and easily dealt
with the man.


Peru session 3, 2018-11-11
--------------------------

### 22nd of March, 1921 (early morning)

Dr. Crane examined the body of the man who attacked your pack animals,
and the wound on the animal, and determined that it matched the wound
on Rizo's body back in Lima.  He judged that it was probably a similar
creature which had attacked her.  Larkin appeared shocked, asking
"what was that man?", but you realised he was lying: he seemed
surprised that the attack had occurred, but not by the man's
existence.  You buried the man and the animal to avoid attracting
scavenging animals, and returned to bed.

### 22nd of March, 1921

The second day and night of your journey passed uneventfully.

### 23rd of March, 1921

In the third afternoon, you saw two people heading in the same
direction as you, half a mile ahead.  Larkin suggested they may be
local farmers.  You failed to catch up with them.

You arrived at the pyramid, looking down upon it from half-way up a
mountain.  The plateau which held it had no vegetation, just dirt,
rock, a pit next to the south wall, and the part-buried pyramid with a
crack running along the top.  Two figures were below: you could see
one standing next to the pyramid, and one climbing the side.  The one
climbing the side crouched over the crack for a few minutes, then both
went to the pit next to the south wall and climbed down.

The air swarmed with flies, which Prof. Musgrave identified as
bloatflies, which feed on carrion.

You descended to the pyramid and had a look around.  You found:

* The pit the people had climbed down into, which was full of
  emaciated and shrunken bodies in various states of decay; the air
  full of flies and the stench of death.
* The crack atop the pyramid, about 5cm wide, which did not offer a
  clear view.  It also stank of corruption and swarmed with flies.
* A couple of shafts covered with stone slabs, which appeared to
  descend to some underground tunnels.

You decided to wade through the bodies, following the two people, to
reduce the risk of being caught unawares if you used a different
entrance.  Larkin feigned his illness acting up to avoid going in, but
when confronted confessed that he suffered claustrophobia, and didn't
realise just what it would be like at the pyramid.  Jason Steele
stayed with Larkin while the rest of you descended.

Wandering the narrow tunnels, you found a room full of shiny trinkets
from all ages: coins, jewellery, watches, cutlery, and so on; gathered
and piled up with no apparent organisation.  You also saw the two
people from earlier, fast asleep on filthy mats on the floor.  They
were thin, unnaturally so, but didn't appear to be suffering for it.

You tried to bind the two people, a man and a woman, without waking
them up.  You succeeded with the man, but the woman woke up, but you
managed to subdue her.  You tried questioning her, but got no answer.
You tried giving her food, which she ate, but not with the reckless
abandon you would expect from a victim of starvation.  Leaving them
behind, you continued to explore the tunnels.

You arrived at the buried walls of the pyramid, which had a
familiar-looking golden band embedded into them.  You followed the
band, and reached a point where it had been torn away.  There was a
crack along the wall from the floor to the ceiling, and a hole in the
floor which had filled with a rank-smelling white liquid.  Lady
Ashdown saw rippling in the pool, as if something were moving beneath
the surface.

Dr. Crane lowered a sample container into the pool, and the ripples
surged towards it.  He withdrew the container and examined the
contents, but without much insight.  He tried setting it alight, and
it burst into flames with such a violence he started and dropped the
flaming container into the pool, setting the whole thing alight.
Black smoke billowed into the tunnel.  Jackson Elias dropped to the
ground, and to fresh air, dragging Wilhelmina with him; but the rest
of you inhaled the smoke and collapsed unconscious.

On the surface, Jason Steele saw the smoke emerging, and tried to move
one of the stone slabs covering the shafts, to let the smoke escape
more rapidly.  As he was struggling with that, he heard footsteps from
behind.  He turned, and it was Larkin, but not Larkin as you knew him.
This Larkin stood straight and tall, with no sign of his usual
illness, and his eyes were totally black.  Jason Steele felt his mind
go blank as Larkin said "you will go into the pyramid and destroy the
golden seal."

Jason climbed down into the tunnels, touching the golden band.  He
briefly fought to overcome this compulsion upon him, but could not.
He struck the band with a crowbar, creating a new crack.  A brief
earthquake shook the ground.

Lady Ashdown, Dr. Crane, and Prof. Musgrave regained consciousness
just in time to see Jason Steele strike the band and feel the ground
shake.  "What have you done," Prof. Musgrave cried, and Jason Steele
babbled for a few moments about Larkin.

You decided to try repairing the golden band with the gold in the
other room, as the band was set into the wall of the pyramid, so it
was clear where gold needed to be.  Prof. Musgrave hammered the golden
mirror he found in Luis de Mendoza's room into the cavity in the wall.
You all then turned to go fetch more gold to finish the repair, and
were confronted by Luis de Mendoza, seemingly back from the dead.

"Destroy the seal," he said, the first words you had heard him speak.
He had a gun aimed at you.  When you didn't cooperate, he shot
Prof. Musgrave, who failed to dodge, and lay on the ground bleeding
heavily.  Jason Steele shot Mendoza twice with his shotgun, inflicting
a terrible wound, and knocking him back onto the ground, apparently
dead once more.  The horror of what you all just witnessed began to
sink in: a dead man came back to kill you.  Dr. Crane picked the
bullet out of Prof. Musgrave and bandaged him up.  Prof. Musgrave
gained a nascent phobia of bullets.

<aside class="highlight">
Musgrave gains ballisophobia.
</aside>

You quickly fetched more gold and continued the repair, but nothing
seemed to happen.  Jason Steele decided to pick up Mendoza's body and
see if the seal burned it, like the fragment of seal in the university
storage room did.  But as he picked up Mendoza, the body crumbled away
into dust.  You dashed back to the room with the two people in, and
saw that the man had also turned to dust.  The woman was still alive,
but looked incredibly feeble, and seemed to worsen before your very
eyes.  She seemed confused and afraid, asking what was happening.
Prof. Musgrave offered her some food, but as she reached out her arm
to take it, she fell back dead.

Jason Steele and Prof. Musgrave came out onto the surface to find
Larkin sitting down, looking very feeble, with no sign of the power
which had filled him before.  He told you that he had come to this
pyramid once before, with some locals, and that he didn't really
remember what happened.  He found himself back in Lima, with a
compulsion to find some people to take to the pyramid and destroy the
golden seal.  He couldn't do it himself, it repelled the power within
him.  This is where you, and his expedition, came in.

You then lowered a rope down one of the shafts for the rest of you to
climb out.  Jackson Elias carried a bag full of golden coins, and said
sheepishly "well, this is why we came, right?"

Then we had a time skip to everyone parting ways at the port in Lima.

None of you seemed particularly sad to be leaving Peru, and a few of
you said you'd hope to never cross paths with Larkin again.  Larkin
said that he was just glad everyone survived this expedition, and that
he hoped nothing like this would ever happen again.  Jason Steele and
Dr. Crane realised Larkin was lying; but the point of no return had
been passed, and they couldn't turn back to confront him.

### End

This is the end of this chapter.  Bonus sanity points are:

- `+1d6` for killing Luis de Mendoza.
- `+1d8` for restoring the ward on the pyramid.

The next chapter is after a four-year time skip.  We'll start with a
brief character-tweaking phase where I'll award some bonus skill
points.


America session 1, 2018-11-24
-----------------------------

It's 1925, four years after the events of Peru, and you have all
received a message from Jackson Elias saying that he's uncovered new
information about the Carlyle Expedition, and needed a reliable team
of investigators to help him.

The Carlyle Expedition of 1919 was an archaeological expedition to
Egypt funded by wealthy playboy Roger Carlyle.  The expedition
primaries were:

- **Roger Carlyle** - wealthy playboy.

- **Sir Aubrey Penhew** - renowned Egyptologist and founder of the
  Penhew Foundation in London.

- **Dr. Robert Huston** - a fashionable Freudian psychologist, on the
  expedition to conduct research into ancient pictographs.

- **Hypatia Masters** - a socialite acting as photographer and
  archivist.

- **Jack Brady** - Rodger Carlyle's loyal bodyguard and manservant.

After Egypt, the expedition went to Nairobi, to unwind on a safari.
That was the last time the expedition members were seen alive.  Two
months after their disappearance, Erica Carlyle, the sister of Roger
Carlyle, arrived in Nairobi with an expedition of her own: to find her
brother.  The remains of the Carlyle Expedition were found, massacred
by tribesmen, who were executed for their crimes.

This was all over the newspapers of the time, and it was thought to be
a settled issue.  Jackson Elias finding new information is quite a
surprise.

### 15th of January, 1925

On the morning of the 15th of January, the day Jackson Elias asked to
see you all, you all made your way to Prospero House, Jackson's
publisher, to ask about his whereabouts, as his message was
nonspecific.  There you were reunited with Wilhelmina, who has moved
to New York and is working there as a secretary.

You met Jonah Kensington, the owner of Prospero House and Jackson's
friend, who told you that Jackson is staying in room 410 of the Hotel
Chelsea.  You made your way to the Hotel Chelsea and were directed to
room 410 by a man at the reception desk.

Upon arriving at room 410, you found the door locked, and no answer to
your knocking.  You noticed some workmen on the fire escape outside,
and asked if they'd seen a man matching Jackson's description leave,
but they irritably brushed you off and returned to work.  Wilhelmina
investigated the possibility of climbing down to the fire escape
outside Jackoson's room from the floor above.  Jason Steele picked the
lock.

Inside room 410 you found your good friend Jackson Elias, sprawled
over a large chair, eviscerated and with a symbol carved into his
forehead.  Prof. Musgrave screamed, and ran back down to the
reception.  The window was open, and the fire escape visible beyond.
Items were scattered around the room.  Dr. Crane determined that the
murder had been done recently, in the last few hours.

The room contained a telephone, and you called the police.  The
receptionist downstairs also called the police.  While waiting for the
police to arrive, you looked around, and found a few items:

- A business card for Edward Gavigan, director of the London-based
  Penhew Foundation.

- A business card for Emerson Imports, with the name "Silas N'Kwane"
  written on the back in Jackson's hand.

- A handbill for a public lecture at New York University entitled "The
  Cult of Darkness in Polynesia & The Southwest Pacific", by
  Prof. Anthony Cowley of the University of Sydney, currently a
  visiting professor at Miskatonic University.

Jason Steele got in touch with his friend Chester Sullivan, an agency
detective.  He arrived at around the same time as two police officers,
who treated him with a professional respect and let him perform his
investigation in tandem with their own.

One of the officers made a phone call to Lt. Poole, saying that the
murder was the same as the ones in the Hilton Adams case of last year.
About 45 minutes later, Lt. Poole arrived, and sent Chester Sullivan
away.  Lt. Poole asked you about your connection to Jackson Elias.  He
was satisfied by your answers, and when you asked about the Hilton
Adams case held nothing back.

A string of similar murders, where the victims all had the same symbol
carved into their forehead, had occurred last year.  Lt. Poole was
looking into the case, but had no leads.  There was no connection
between the victims: rich and poor, black and white.  Captain Robson
insisted that the case be transferred to him, which it was, and he
quickly closed the case when he found Hilton Adams at the scene of one
such murder.  Hilton Adams was convicted with only circumstantial
evidence, and Lt. Poole suspects that Captain Robson had been bribed
to shut down the case.  Given the diversity of victims, Lt. Poole
suspects that they are all people who learned too much about some
secret.

Lt. Poole gave you his contact details, and said he would be in touch
if necessary.  You then left the scene.  Wilhelmina decided to go back
to Prospero House to inform Jonah Kensington of the death; the rest of
you decided to go to Emerson Imports to ask about Silas N'Kwane.

Jonah was shocked by the revelation, and immediately contacted Carlton
Ramsey, Jackson's lawyer, to arrange an urgent meeting.  Wilhelmina
tagged along.

By the time Jonah and Wilhelmina arrived at Carlton Ramsey's office,
he had been informed by the police of Jackson's death.  After
discussing the arrangements for the funeral the next day, Carlton
turned to Wilhelmina and asked if she and Jackson's other friends
could see him after the funeral for the reading of the will.
Wilhelmina agreed, and asked if they knew anything about Jackson's
recent work; they did, but thought it best to wait until tomorrow.
Wilhelmina also asked about Prof. Anthony Cowles, but they didn't know
the man.

Wilhelmina then headed to New York University to enquire about the
lecture.

At Emerson Imports you met Arthur Emerson, who made a sour expression
when you brought up Silas N'Kwane.  He said that Silas didn't work for
him, that he was a customer who used Emerson Imports to import African
trinkets for his shop.  Something about N'Kwane made Emerson's skin
crawl; he doesn't like the man.  He gave you the address of Ju-Ju
House, N'Kwane's shop.

Ju-Ju House is a very small shop, full of African trinkets, souvenirs,
display weapons, and so on.  The aged proprietor, Silas N'Kwane, said
he didn't know a Jackson Elias.  You determined that he wasn't being
entirely truthful, but he persisted in his claim.  He suggested that
maybe Jackson Elias had got his name from Mr. Emerson, but had never
come to the shop.  To get on his good side, Prof. Musgrave bought a
wooden animal, which seemed to improve Silas' opinion of you.

You then all headed to New York University as well.

At the university, you all reunited at the reception.  The lecture was
last week, and Prof. Cowles had since returned to Arkham.  You then
went to the anthropology department, on the hunch that if anyone
attended a talk about cults it was probably them, and Jason Steele
stopped people until he found a timid graduate student willing to
summarise the lecture.

The lecture was about the Cult of the Sand Bat, once widespread
amongst Australian Aborigines.  This cult worshipped a being known as
the Sand Bat, or the Father of All Bats, and partook in human
sacrifice.  They believed that by sacrificing, they would become
worthy for their god, who would appear to the world and conquer it,
turning it into a paradise for the cult.  There was also a legend that
the Sand Bat had a battle with the Rainbow Snake, another aboriginal
god---the deification of water and life---who tricked the Sand Bat,
and sealed it and all his clan in a watery place from which the Sand
Bat cannot escape.

### 16th of January, 1925

You saw an article in the New York Times about the similarity of
Jackson Elias' murder and the crimes for which Hilton Adams had been
arrested, who was at this time on death row.  The author was Rebecca
Shosenburg.

In the afternoon you went to the funeral.  It was a brief,
non-denominational, and poorly attended ceremony.  Only you, the
priest, Carlton Ramsey, his niece, and Jonah Kensington were there.
Outside the cemetery, some reporters watched.  After the ceremony
concluded, you left with Carlton to go to his office.  As you walked
by the reporters, one pushed to the front and introduced herself as
Rebecca Shosenburg, asking if you had any opinions on the similarity
of this murder to the Hilton Adams case.  You brushed her off and
continued to the office.

At the office, Carlton offered you some bootleg bourbon before the
reading of the will.  He said that Jackson had been by the day before
his death to update his will.  Jackson hadn't said anything, but
Carlton believed that Jackson was afraid, and wanted to prepare for
the worst.

The key points of the will are: that Elias has given full power of
attorney to Carlton, with complete authority to liquidate his assets;
that Carlton is to use these assets to create and manage a fund to
continue Jackson's investigation; and that you, named in the will, are
the preferred people to carry on this investigation.  Carlton is also
to act as a central point of contact, and a recruiter if people with
specialised skills, or new investigators, are required.

Jackson left a note, to be read in the event of his death, which
encouraged you to continue his investigation and find his killers.
Jackson had also left some of his papers:

- A letter, dated 1919 and sent from Cairo, from a M. Warren Besart to
  Roger Carlyle.

- A blurry photograph showing some boats in the foreground and
  buildings in the background.

- A letter to Jackson Elias from Miriam Atwright at the Harvard
  University Library.

You all agreed to join the quest and continue in Jackson's footsteps.


America session 2, 2018-12-08
-----------------------------

### 17th of January, 1925

You visited Prospero House to ask Jonah Kensington for Jackson Elias'
book notes.  There was a letter, sent from Nairobi, saying that while
the authorities denied the cult aspect of the Carlyle massacre, the
locals thought differently.  With the letter was a bundle of notes.
The notes revealed that the bodies had been found in an area shunned
by the local tribes, who said it was cursed by the God of the Black
Wind, revered by the Cult of the Bloody Tongue.  The bodies had been
torn apart and, contrary to the official report, only included the
Kenyan bearers from the Carlyle party.

Jason Steele noticed that Jonah held back some papers, and persuaded
him to share them.  More notes by Jackson, but in messy handwriting
and very rambling.  These notes talked about dreams---"dreams like
Carlyle's?"---and say that "many names, many forms" are all working
towards one end, to "open the gate".  The notes also say "the books
are in Carlyle's safe..."

You then used Jonah's office phone to make some calls.  Firstly you
rang Miskatonic University, hoping to talk to Prof. Cowles about his
recent lecture.  He was unavailable, but you arranged for the
receptionist to contact Carlton Ramsey when she knew when Prof. Cowles
would be available to talk.  You also rang Harvard University Library
to talk with Miriam Atwright, about the book Jackson was looking for.
The book disappeared from the library, leaving behind only a terrible
smell of decay, and the police haven't found any leads yet.

You then decided to investigate the principals of the Carlyle
Expedition.

Dr. Crane went to the archives of the New York City Medical Affairs
Board, and managed to talk his way by the security guard.  He found
Dr. Robert Huston's notes about Roger Carlyle.  The notes say that
Roger was referred by his sister, Erica, to discuss his dreams.

Roger dreams of being called by a voice through the mist.  He follows
the voice, and finds a tall dark man with an inverted ankh blazing
upon his forehead.  The man reveals his palms, Roger's face is in one,
a misshapen pyramid is in the other.  The hands are brought together,
and Roger finds himself propelled into space.  He sees an array of
monstrous creatures, all circling a ball of energy which Roger
recognises as another aspect of the calling man.  Roger is drawn into
the ball, and a misshapen triangle appears in the void.  The creatures
rush into the triangle as the voice says "and become with me a god"
and Roger awakes.  Roger has no waking interest in anything Egyptian.
He also does not consider this a nightmare, and that he feels it is a
genuine calling.

Notes about later sessions are briefer.  Roger talks about someone
called M'Weru, who he calls "my priestess" and devotes himself to.  In
the final session, Huston says "if I do not go, C. threatens
exposure."

You decided to pay a visit to the Carlyle mansion, which lies to the
north of New York City.  You parked the car out of sight and peeked
in: a tall three-storey building with acres of surrounding grounds,
and a tall fence with a single guarded entrance.  You decided not to
try to sneak in and rob the safe.

### 18th of January, 1925

You visited Hilton Adams, arrested for the previous murders, in Sing
Sing Prison.  You got half an hour to speak with him.

Hilton Adams was a community leader of sorts, who grew concerned with
the murders and decided to take matters into his own hands.  He found
that the murders fanned out in a rough circle for about a mile west of
the Harlem River; but none within a two block radius of West 137th
Street, between Lenox Avenue and the Harlem River[^jan18_1]---except
the one which had him arrested.  A Dr. Mordecai Lemming had been
quoted in the papers saying the murders seemed similar to those
conducted by the Cult of the Bloody Tongue, an African death cult.  As
Ju-Ju House is the only thing African in the vicinity, Hilton staked
it out.  One day he managed to follow a muscular, shaven, African man
in his late 30s from Ju-Ju House to a coffee shop on 139th Street and
Sixth Avenue.  Nobody seemed keen to talk about this man, just saying
that he was Mukunga M'Dari, and he was bad news.  Shortly after that,
Hilton's knife was found at the scene of a murder, on a night Hilton
had gone out patrolling.  This caused his arrest.  But that night
Hilton says he went out with his gun.

[^jan18_1]: This is roughly the same location as the Ju-Ju House,
  which you previously visited.  Ju-Ju House is at 1 Ransom Court,
  down an alley off West 137th Street, east of Lenox Avenue.

When you returned from Sing Sing, you managed to get a phone call with
Prof. Cowles, who gave you a full summary of his lecture.  The
graduate student you talked to previously covered most of it,
Prof. Cowles additionally described some photos from his slides: each
of sweating men standing beside enormous blocks of stone, pitted and
eroded, but clearly formed for architectural purposes.  Cowles says
that the discovered, a Arthur MacWhirr of Port Hedland, Australia,
kept a diary in which he recorded several attacks on the party by
Aboriginals, and records deaths to victims from hundreds of small
punctures, reminiscent of the bat cult.

You then wanted to learn some more about Erica Carlyle, so you went to
the New York Public Library to look through its newspaper archives.
Outside, you bought today's newspaper, and found mention that the
Carlyle munitions business had become the biggest in the state, due to
the careful management of Erica Carlyle and her lawyer, Bradley Grey.
Grey is a partner in one of the top law firms in New York, but was
described as almost a personal assistant to Erica.

After debating a few ways of getting in touch with Erica Carlyle and
being invited into the mansion, you decided to send her a letter
saying that you were reopening the investigation into her brother
Roger and his ill-fated expedition.

You then went into the newspaper archives to try to find out some
information about Hypatia Masters, as there seemed no obvious reason
why a socialite would go on the expedition.  You found a mention, some
months before the expedition, that she and Roger had begun dating.


America session 3, 2019-01-19
-----------------------------

### 22nd of January, 1925

You received a rather cold reply from Bradley Grey to your letter to
Erica Carlyle about re-opening the investigation into the Carlyle
Expedition.  He made it clear that you would have to convince him
there was some merit to your investigation before he would arrange a
meeting with Erica.  You got in touch with Bradley Grey's assistant to
arrange a meeting.  He had thought you might, and left a spot free in
his calendar the next day.

### 23rd of Janaury, 1925

At the meeting, Jason Steele (everyone but Wilhelmina attended), tried
to convince Bradley Grey by explaining how Jackson Elias had been
looking into the Carlyle Expedition when he was murdered.  Bradley
Grey was initially unconvinced, but was impressed enough by
Prof. Musgrave's credentials to accept that you probably weren't just
trying to make some money off of the Carlyle family.  He arranged a
meeting with Erica and also told you a little about the Carlyle
Expedition principles:

- Roger Carlyle had a poor reputation amongst the investors, and the
  company's fortunes have picked up since Erica took over.

- Hypatia Masters was a socialite from a wealthy family who dated
  Roger, she was known amongst amateur circles as a skilled
  photographer.

- Jack "Brass" Brady, Roger's bodyguard and manservant, was a
  condemned man saved by Roger's lawyers, who became incredibly
  devoted and loyal to his saviour.

- He only knew Sir Aubrey Penhew by reputation, and that Dr. Robert
  Huston was a psychoanalysist favoured by Erica Carlyle.

### 25th of January, 1925

You returned to the Carlyle estate, this time not hiding your car
behind a hill, and were ushered into a reception hall to meet Erica
Carlyle.  After introductions, she led you to a sitting room and you
talked about Roger.

She told you that Roger had been having bad dreams for several months
before the expedition, waking screaming.  He refused to discuss these
dreams, and eventually Erica referred him to Dr. Huston.  A month or
so after the dreams began, Roger became involved with "that Negro
woman, Bunay".  Erica doesn't know who this Bunay is, but Roger became
increasingly obsessed with her, describing her as "queenly", and "a
priestess".  Roger began to disappear for days at a time, saying only
that he had been to Harlem on his return.  Bunay had accompanied the
expedition.

You then asked about the books in the safe.  Erica was unable to hide
her surprise, saying that Roger had spent a lot of time pouring over
old books in the months leading up to the expedition.  Roger had hid
the books in a safe, and not even told Erica about them, so she was
surprised that you knew.  You convinced her to show you the books, and
she summoned a guard and took you to the library.

You waited outside while she fetched the books.  When you went in,
there were four books arranged on a table, and no sign of a safe.  The
books were:

- **The Pnakotic Manuscripts** - centuries old and written in English.

- **Selections de Livre D'Ivon** - centuries old and written in a
  language none of you recognised (French).

- **Amongst the Stones** - fairly recent, English, handwritten, and
  bound in some sort of skin.

- **Life As A God** - fairly recent, English, and bound in human skin.

Over the next few hours Prof. Musgrave read *Amongst the Stones* and
Lady Ashdown read *Life As A God* (after Wilhelmina tried and failed).
*Amongst the Stones* is a collection of poetry, and one stood out.  It
was about the regal garments of Queen Nitocris of Egypt, in great
detail.  *Life As A God* is the diary of English artist Montgomery
Crompton, who went to Egypt in 1805 and became a priest of the
Brotherhood of the Black Pharaoh.  Crompton was insane when he wrote
the diary.  It describes unspeakable acts committed in the name of the
Black Pharaoh, and the hidden throne room of Bent Pyramid.

By the time you finished reading, Erica Carlyle had left, and the
guard politely suggested that you would be overstaying your welcome if
you remained any longer.  You took the hint and left.

### 26th of January, 1925

Jason Steele decided to stake out Ju-Ju House, and Wilhelmina the cafe
mentioned by Hilton Adams.  In the mid-morning, Jason saw a white man
poorly concealing a gun beneath his jacket enter the Ju-Ju House.  The
man left a few minutes later stuffing an envelope into his inside
pocket.  Jason followed the man to a nearby police station, and
watched for a while, but the man did not come out.  Jason peered
through the windows, and was seen; but managed to outrun the police.
The only thing of note to happen at the cafe is that Silas N'Kwane,
owner of Ju-Ju House, went for lunch.

### 27th of January, 1925

You continued your stake-outs.  In mid-afternoon, a man matching
Mukunga M'Dari's description paid a short visit to the Ju-Ju House,
and then headed in the direction of the cafe.  Jason followed.  The
man arrived at the cafe, and a few minutes later Jason also entered.
Jason got the attention of Wilhelmina and indicated to Mukunga M'Dari.
Mukunga spoke quietly to a waiter, and was led through a door.

Wilhelmina got the attention of a waiter and asked what was through
the door.  The waiter judged that she was not with the police, and
seemed a trustworthy sort, so he told her that it is the door to a
speakeasy.  Wilhelmina went through the door, which took her to a
staircase leading down to the basement.

At this time of day the speakeasy was not particularly busy, but it
had a fair few customers.  Mukunga M'Dari was sitting by himself with
his drink.  Wilhelmina asked the bartender who he (Mukunga) was, and
learned that he has a bad reputation.  He has no apparent employment,
but always has money; he seems to be friendly with the police; and
people don't like to mess with him.  Wilhelmina finished her drink and
left, collecting Jason from the cafe.


America session 4, 2019-02-10
-----------------------------

### 27th of January, 1925

You decided to break in to the Ju-Ju House[^jan27_1], so Jason and
Wilhelmina arrived around closing time and watched the shop for a few
hours.

[^jan27_1]: Because I mentioned that I assumed were going to do that,
  and you all thought it was a reasonable enough idea.

### 28th of January, 1925 (midnight)

A little after midnight, a light was still on inside, though the
curtains were drawn across the shop window so you couldn't see in.
Jason peered through the keyhole, and saw Silas N'Kwane bent over
something behind the counter.

Wilhelmina found a back door down an alley, and Jason picked the lock.
You cautiously entered a small dark room, separated from the shopfront
by a thick curtain, and which looked like Silas N'Kwane's living
quarters.  Wilhelmina looked through the curtain and saw Silas opening
a trap door behind the counter.  He heard the curtain move and looked
up, but did not see Wilhelmina.  He entered the back room, but Jason
managed to hide in a closet in time.  Wilhelmina lead Silas out of the
back door, giving Jason enough time to enter the shopfront, and
descend the stairs beneath the open trap door.

Jason entered a large basement, running under the entire building.  At
one end was a large well with a stone cover, about 2 metres in
diameter.  Half way along the wall opposite the entrance was a curtain
covering an alcove.  It was completely silent.

Jason approached the curtain, and peered beneath it.  Inside the
alcove were four pairs of standing bare feet, two along the wall to
the left and two along the wall to the right.  These looked like the
feet of living people, rather than a statue or something like that,
but still there was no noise.

Jason slowly and quietly got to his feet, grasped the curtain in one
hand and a camera in the other.  He dramatically whisked the curtain
aside, to reveal four people, their foreheads branded with the same
symbol as Jackson Elias, their intestines spilling out of open wounds,
their skin decaying, and their eyes completely black.  Their heads
snapped to the side to look at Jason, who took a photo and ran.  They
leaped after him, but he got to the stairs, and they would not follow
out of the basement.

Jason climbed the stairs, to be faced with Silas N'Kwane.  Jason
managed to shove him out of the way, climbed over the counter, and
jumped through the front window, being wounded a little by broken
glass in the process.  Wilhelmina had brought the car around, and they
escaped to Jason's office.  Jason developed the photo in his darkroom,
pacing impatiently while waiting for it to process.  In the early
morning, the photo was ready.  Jason called everyone around, along
with Lt. Poole, who came to investigate Jackson Elias' murder, and
shared the photo.

Lt. Poole shakily asked where the photo was taken, and commented that
that was Captain Robson's territory.  Captain Robson is the one who
arrested Hilton Adams for the previous murders.  Lt. Poole called a
squad of officers to go visit the Ju-Ju House.

You all, except Wilhelmina who was still sleeping, arrived at the
Ju-Ju House with police backup.  Lt. Poole took command of the
situation, taking Silas N'Kwane into custody and demanding access to
the basement.  Silas looked surprised and briefly annoyed---as if he
didn't expect the police, of all people, to do this---before changing
his demeanour to meek submission.  The trap door was revealed beneath
a rug, and you all descended.  Prof. Musgrave stayed outside, due to
his ballistophobia.

In the basement was Mukunga M'Dari, surrounded by the four people.
Several of you gasped at the sight.  Dr. Crane attempted to
rationalise the situation by saying that they must be victims of
torture, probably drugged which is why they can stand and move around
at all with those wounds, but others were less convinced.  Lt. Poole
shouted for everyone to put their hands where he could see them and
not to make any sudden moves.  Mukunga complied, the four didn't move.

One of the officers approached the four, and put his hand on their
shoulder to guide them down to the floor.  As soon as he made physical
contact, the person spun around and snapped the officer's arm in two
with incredible speed.  The other three adopted fighting postures, and
all moved between Mukunga and the police.  The wounded man passed out
due to the pain and was carried to the back of the room, where
Dr. Crane treated him.  Dr. Crane and Clarissa carried him out while
the police opened fire.  The four people seemed unaffected by the
bullets, being knocked back but otherwise not appearing to suffer from
the onslaught.  They shielded Mukunga, who was hiding behind them
still.

Jason realised he still had some dynamite[^jan28_1], and decided to
use it.  He threw it, but fumbled his grip a little, and hit one of
the officers.  The dynamite fell in the middle of the room.  You and
all but one of the police managed to escape from the basement before
it exploded.

[^jan28_1]: From Peru.

As the explosion ripped through the basement, there was suddenly a
sound of dozens of voices---far more than there had been in the
basement---wailing in agony.  Jason and Dr. Crane returned to the
basement and cautiously entered.  Mukunga and the four people had been
torn apart by the dynamite.  The stone seal over the well had been
cracked open, and the noise was coming from there.  Thinking it might
be more torture victims, Dr. Crane approached.

In the well Dr. Crane saw a great writhing mass of tentacles, or
perhaps worms, covered in screaming human faces.  In a bout of
madness, he threw up and ran, screaming, from the basement.  He made
it past the surprised officers in the shopfront, and was only caught
outside.  Seeing what had happened, Jason decided not to approach the
well.

Jason investigated the alcove, as the photo he took showed a
bulky-looking bag, and found:

- A cloth headdress with a severed human tongue attached to the front.

- A robe made of feathers.

- The book **Africa's Dark Sects**, which Jackson Elias was looking
  for at Harvard University Library.  The book details Nigel
  Blackwell's travels across Africa and the cults he encountered on
  the way, including a description in great detail of a cult summoning
  the monster they worship.  It contains one spell, and will take
  several weeks to study fully.

- A woven wooden mask, like a woven basket, but with no eyeholes.  On
  the top of the mask are four monstrous faces, at right angles to
  each other.  Prof. Musgrave identified the mask being possibly from
  the Congo.

- A wooden sceptre carved with hieroglyphics saying "Nyambe, Thy Power
  Mine".  From the context, Nyambe is a given name, but not one any of
  you are familiar with.

- A marine chronometer, a very accurate clock used by sailors to
  calculate their position.  It was set to GMT, rather than local
  time.

Jason managed to persuade Lt. Poole that there was enough evidence
left at the Ju-Ju House for him to conduct an investigation, and to
overturn the conviction of Hilton Adams, and he allowed you to take
the items from the alcove.

Having exhausted the trail in New York, you decided to follow an
earlier lead to the Penhew Foundation, and set sail for London.  The
crossing took 9 days, during which you attempted to rest and to
recover some of your sanity.

### End

This is the end of this chapter. Bonus sanity points are:

- `+1d6` for effectively solving Jackson Elias' murder.
- `+1d4` for finding enough evidence to get Hilton Adams off death
  row.
- `+1d6` for neutralising Mukunga M'Dari.
- `+1d4` for breaking up the cult.

The next chapter will begin with you arriving in England.


England session 1, 2019-03-16
-----------------------------

It's been nine uneventful days at sea since you departed New York, and
now Southampton is in sight.  From there you can catch a train to
London, at the time the heart of the British Empire, the greatest city
in the world, and famous for its incredibly thick fogs.

You came to London following two leads:

- The Carlyle Expedition, which briefly stopped over in London and
  picked up the Egyptologist Sir Aubrey Penhew, founder of the Penhew
  Foundation.

- And Jackson Elias, who had a business card for Edward Gavigan, the
  current director of the Penhew Foundation, in his hotel room.

Before we get into the game, I'd like to bring up some mechanics, and
also talk about some backstories.

Firstly, Dr. Carson Crane is indefinitely insane.  This means that
losing even one point of sanity will cause him to suffer a bout of
madness, and also he can have sensory hallucinations at any time.  You
can take sanity damage from hallucinating a mythos creature.  Luke, if
you think Dr. Crane is hallucinating, there are two things you can do:

- You can make a Reality Check roll, which is a Sanity roll.  If you
  succeed you see through the delusion, and can't have any more until
  you take some sanity damage.  If you fail, you take one point of
  sanity damage and suffer a bout of madness.

- Or you can make a Psychoanalysis roll.  If you succeed, you see
  through the delusion.

The only way to recover from indefinite insanity is to spend months in
an asylum recuperating.

Secondly, there's a mechanic I forgot about.  If an investigator
suffers insanity from a mythos source, they gain one point of Cthulhu
Mythos, or five points the first time.  I've given you all an extra
eight points of Cthulhu Mythos, which probably covers it.

Now, backstories.

Lady Clarissa Ashdown, it's a bit unusual to be a Lady in your own
right at such a young age.  Normally your mother would be "Lady
Ashdown" by virtue of being married to Lord Ashdown.  Are you actually
a lady, or do you just call yourself that because you have noble
parents?  What's your family situation like?[^england0_1]

[^england0_1]: Possible follow ups depending on the answer: Is Lord
  Ashdown a member of the House of Lords?  Where are the Ashdowns
  based?

Professor Musgrave, you must know of the Penhew Foundation, unless
you've spent your entire academic career under a rock.  You certainly
know that it was established in 1890 by Sir Aubrey Penhew who, as
director of the Foundation, funded and oversaw several expeditions to
Egypt.  When Sir Aubrey was presumed dead after the massacre of the
Carlyle Expedition, Edward Gavigan became director.  The Foundation
issues grants to scholars undertaking the study of Egyptian history
and antiquities.  It also helps out with planning and funding
expeditions, negotiating permits with Egyptian authorities, hiring
local labour, et cetera.  The Foundation building itself is partly
offices, partly museum.  Have you been on an expedition supported by
the Penhew Foundation?[^england0_2]

[^england0_2]: Possible follow up depending on the answer: Do you have
  a research membership to the Penhew Foundation?

Now, before you all disembark, there's one more thing.  Firearms are
illegal in England at this time unless you have a permit, except
shotguns which are considered weapons for hunting game.  Everyone who
is bringing a gun into the country make a Luck roll now.

### 10th of February, 1925

You arrived in Southampton, ready to begin the next leg of your
adventure.

Prof. Musgrave, who has had dealings with the Penhew Foundation and
Edward Gavigan before, rang the Foundation to arrange an interview.
Thomas Kinnery, Edward Gavigan's personal secretary, arranged a
meeting for the following day, in the late morning.

You then hopped aboard a train, which took you to London in about six
hours.  You spent the rest of the day sorting out your accommodation,
finding a regular meeting place to discuss the events of each day, and
planning the next day.

### 11th of February, 1925

Wilhelmina decided not to accompany you to the interview with Edward
Gavigan, and went to look through newspaper archives for any new
information relating to the Carlyle Expedition.

The rest of you went to the Penhew Foundation and were greeted by
Thomas Kinnery.  He took you to an anteroom outside Edward Gavigan's
office, where you took seats, and he returned to work.  Jason Steele
got up to examine the room, which was decorated with Egyptian scrolls,
and some information about the Foundation's previous expeditions.

After a few minutes, Edward Gavigan emerged from his office, and
greeted Prof. Musgrave like an old friend before ushering you all in.
The office itself was quite bare, there were chairs, a desk with a
photo facing away from you, a cupboard against one wall, and a floor
safe in one corner of the room, its door ajar.

Prof. Musgrave trusts Edward Gavigan, and so told him the story so far
(if a little abridged when it came to the more unbelievable
components).  Gavigan confirmed that Jackson Elias, "that journalist
working for The Scoop"[^feb11_1], had come to visit him and ask some
questions about the work of the Foundation.  Gavigan had been pleased
to talk about the Foundation's role in grant funding and assistance
with travel permits and the like.  It had been a short meeting, and he
had never heard from Jackson Elias again.

[^feb11_1]: You have never heard of The Scoop before, and Jackson
  Elias was not a journalist.  You guessed that this is probably a
  cover story Jackson gave.

You then asked about the Carlyle Expedition.  Gavigan said that Roger
Carlyle had obtained information from "an African woman" about a
shadowy time in Egyptian history where the Nile had been ruled by a
sorcerer.  Sir Aubrey had been interested in this period as well.
Unfortunately, the information turned out to be a hoax, and after
conducting some digs in Egypt, the African woman took off with the
money (some £3500).  The loss of the money bothered Carlyle less than
the defection of his lover, and the party went to Kenya to distract
themselves with hunting and wildlife photography.  There they strayed
into unfortunate territory, and paid for it with their lives.  Sir
Aubrey had kept in touch with the Foundation during the expedition,
even sending some artefacts back before they left for Kenya, but
Gavigan would not show you these telegraphs, saying that they
concerned much of young Carlyle and were of a personal nature, not the
sort of thing which the Foundation could afford "getting into the
gutter press."

Gavigan then showed you some of the artefacts in the exhibition hall,
which Prof. Musgrave greatly enjoyed, but the rest of you less so.
While showing the artefacts, Jason Steele returned to Gavigan's
office, with the excuse that he left his hat behind.  Without much
time to spare, to avoid rousing the suspicions of Kinnery, Jason
quickly looked at the photograph on the desk and in the floor safe.

The photograph was of a three storey country house called "Misr
House".  Upon being told this later, Prof. Musgrave recognised "Misr"
as being Arabic for "Egypt".  The safe contained roughly a hundred £1
notes.

Musgrave spent the rest of the afternoon enjoying the Penhew
Foundation's library, where he found a book mentioning the "Black
Pharaoh", a figure of myth who is said to have ruled during the Third
Dynasty.

While this was going on, Wilhelmina spent the entire day in the
newspaper archives, finding nothing new about the Carlyle Expedition,
but finding an article by The Scoop on the "Egyptian Murders" from
right before Jackson Elias was in London.  The article describes a
series of murders with the victims all severely beaten and stabbed
through the heart.

You then reconvened, and decided the next day to check out The Scoop
and Misr House.

### 12th of February, 1925

Prof. Musgrave decided to go with Jason Steele to investigate Misr
House, mostly to keep an eye on Jason, because he didn't want the man
he introduced to Edward Gavigan as a friend, to be found the next day
breaking into Gavigan's country estate.  You both went to the General
Records Office and found that Misr House was located on a 1000 acre
estate on an island in the Naze, in Essex.  You got on a train to
Colchester, intending to change to a local train to
Walton-on-the-Naze, and hire a car from there.

The rest of you went to the offices of The Scoop, located on the third
floor of a grubby building on Fleet Street.  Mention of Jackson Elias
got you to Mickey Mahoney, owner and editor of The Scoop.  He said he
was a friend of Jackson's, and that any friend of Jackson is a friend
of his.  He said that Jackson had been investigating a cult in the
heart of London, but Jackson hadn't told him the details; he would pay
£15 for the story if you bring it to him.  He also said that Jackson
had been interested in three stories The Scoop had printed (the
Egyptian Murders was one), but he couldn't remember the titles of the
other two off the top of his head, and that you were welcome to look
through the back issues to try to find them.  He didn't know of
anything suspicious about the Carlyle Expedition.

After a couple of hours of finding likely looking articles and asking
"is this one?" you finally found the two others that Jackson Elias had
been interested in:

- **Slaughter Continues!  Reward Offered!** - the Egyptian Murders, a
  series of murders in which all the victims had been killed by severe
  beating, and then stabbed through the heart.  Inspector Barrington
  at New Scotland Yard has been investigating, and Mahoney said that
  Jackson Elias had gone to visit him.

- **Shocking Canvases Craze: Local Artist's Monstrous Scenes Mock
  'Surrealists'** - Miles Shipley, a local artist, has been painting
  very realistic scenes of horror, which are said to be visions of
  another place the artist merely makes visible.

- **Police Baffled By Monstrous Murders!  Killer Beast Shot But Still
  Alive?** - two murders and one wounding in Lesser Edale, Derbyshire,
  which have been attributed to a rabid dog.  Despite the dog being
  shot dead, local residents report a strange beast lurking in the
  area which wails on nights of the full moon.

In the afternoon, Prof. Musgrave and Jason arrive at the island of
Misr House, but are turned away by a guard at the one bridge onto the
island.  He says that this is private property owned by Edward
Gavigan, and you cannot come in.  From the bridge you could see Misr
House, but not much else on the island due to the heavy forestation.
Prof. Musgrave seemed a little smug, asking Jason if he was satisfied
now.  You returned to the village to try to gather some information
about the estate.

In the village pub the landlord, after being encouraged to pour a
third drink "for yourself", told you some of the history of the area.
The land and house had previously been owned by an Egyptologist and
occultist Neville Lloyd-Price.  Rumour has it that he went bankrupt
and had to sell the land to pay his debts, Edward Gavigan was the
buyer.  Neville Lloyd-Price has not been seen since the sale,
effectively disappearing from London society.  The house dates from
the time of Queen Elizabeth, and is rumoured to have a priest hole,
used to hide Catholic priests during the religious purges.  The estate
itself is 6000 acres, with the island being 1000.  The surrounding
land is rented out to farmers.  Edward Gavigan doesn't show himself
much, he visits the house occasionally but it doesn't seem to be his
primary residence.  Everyone knows of him as the land owner, but he is
a fairly distant figure.  You then decided to return to London and
meet up with the others in the evening.

The rest of you decided to visit Miles Shipley, the artist, at his
home in Holbein Mews.  You were greeted at the door by an old woman
who introduced herself as Bertha Shipley, Miles' mother.  Upon saying
you were interested in buying some paintings, she took you in to a
sitting room, and called for Miles while she made some tea.  As soon
as you stepped into the house you were struck with a strong biological
smell, which Wilhelmina recognised as the smell of a reptile house.
Upon asking Bertha about it, she seemed embarrassed that you had
noticed, as if she had not realised how strong it was, and said that
she was looking after a friend's reptiles while they were away.

After a few minutes, you heard Miles clattering down the stairs, and
he entered the room.  A quiet and nervous looking young man, you
spotted that his hands were shaking.  He invited you up to the garret
to see the finished paintings.  He took the lead, Dr. Crane, Clarissa,
and Wilhelmina following, and Bertha Shipley bringing up the rear
carrying teacups.  In the garret room you noticed that Miles glanced
over at Bertha, who seemed completely calm, and in charge of the
situation.  She said that the paintings were £75 to £300 each.  The
paintings were:

- **Ancient Science** - an alchemical lab with a reptilian humanoid
  working at a table surrounded by glass jars emitting colourful
  vapours.

- **The Dark Pharaoh** - a processional scene in which a mass of
  people prostrate themselves before a golden chariot.  Standing atop
  the chariot is a pharaoh in black and gold robes, his face turned
  away from the canvas.  Behind the pharaoh, two men have been impaled
  on stakes, and are being eaten by a pack of jackals.

- **Goat Wood** - a nighttime woodland scene illuminated by a yellow
  moon, naked men and women dancing around a bonfire.  Rising from the
  flames is a goat-headed man with outstretched arms.

- **Drawn in Blood** - a man being cut open by a silver dagger, with
  an occult symbol carved into his chest which you can't quite seem to
  focus on.

- **Black Mountain** - a towering mountain over which rises a
  monstrous demonic creature, its head a great tentacle covered in
  blood[^feb12_1].  In a nearby temple-like building, small human
  figures wearing a headdress with a red tentacle[^feb12_2] lift their
  arms towards it in supplication.

[^feb12_1]: This reminds you of the tattoo on Larkin's chest of the
  man with a spiral emerging from his neck in place of a head.

[^feb12_2]: These look like Mukunga M'Dari's headdress you found at
  the Ju-Ju House.

Miles also showed you a painting he is working on entitled **City of
the Great Race**, which depicted tiny human figures next to a colossal
building, but it was still in early stages.  You examined the
paintings themselves, and the art supplies in the room; everything
looked ordinary, other than the subject matter of the paintings.  When
asked about the newspaper article saying that Miles was painting
visions, Bertha said that the newspapers exaggerate everything, which
Miles agreed with.

You pick out **The Dark Pharaoh**, **Drawn in Blood**, and **Black
Mountain** as paintings you would like to buy, and leave to go to the
bank.

While out of the house, you formulated a plan: Clarissa and Dr. Crane
would distract the Shipleys by haggling, while Wilhelmina would sneak
out of the garret and examine the rest of the house.  When you
returned, you put the plan into action, and Wilhelmina slipped out of
the room.

On the first floor, there are four bedrooms.  Three were open and very
dusty, as if they hadn't been used in a long time.  One was locked,
but through the keyhole Wilhelmina could see it looked messy and in
active use.

On the ground floor, in addition to the corridor, stairs, and sitting
room you had seen, there is also a kitchen (which looked normal), and
a dining room and lounge, both of which looked dusty and unused.
There was no sign of reptiles, beyond the pervasive smell.  In the
garden was a locked cellar door which Wilhelmina could not pick.
Wilhelmina quietly returned to the garret, where the Shipleys were
still distracted.  You then exchanged the money, and left with your
paintings.

As you left the house, Wilhelmina asked what reptiles Bertha was
caring for.  Bertha looked momentarily confused, as if she had
forgotten about the reptiles, and then said snakes.

### 12th of February, 1925 (evening)

You discussed the events of the day.  Photos were taken of the symbol
in the **Drawn in Blood** painting, in the hope that a photo might be
easier to focus on.  You then parted ways.  Wilhelmina, suspicious of
Edward Gavigan's refusal to show you the telegraphs from Sir Aubrey
Penhew, decided to go stake out the Foundation, and asked Jason to
join her.  The rest of you went home.

On her way home, Clarissa realised she was being followed, and chased
a man down an alley.  However, he gave her the slip in the thick fog,
and she lost sight of where he went.

Wilhelmina and Jason watched the Penhew Foundation for a few hours,
learning that there is a single night watchman (who patrols
infrequently) and, around the back, a yard large enough for delivery
vehicles, with a visible store room and a coal chute.  You decided to
return the following night and gain entry to the basement through the
chute.

### 13th of February, 1925

You went to see Inspector Barrington at New Scotland Yard about the
Egyptian Murders.  He was able to spare you a little time.  Throughout
the interview he was quite cautious, not giving much away about the
case, and asking about you and your interest.  He said that the press
is calling the murders the "Egyptian Murders" because most of the
victims were Egyptian nationals.  All of the victims are killed by
being beaten and then stabbed through the heart.

Barrington confirmed that he had met Jackson Elias.  Jackson Elias
said he thought the murders were conducted by an Egyptian death cult
known as the Cult of the Black Pharaoh, but due to the lack of
evidence Barrington is not pursuing that particular avenue.
Barrington spoke to the Penhew Foundation, who said that such an
organisation did exist once, but died out centuries ago with no modern
equivalent.

You mentioned that you had dealt with a death cult in New York, and
that such things are not unreasonable.  Barrington seemed unimpressed
by this and quickly drew the interview to a close as you had no leads
for him.

After the interview Wilhelmina and Jason went to buy supplies to break
into the Penhew Foundation that evening (they had still not shared
their plans with Prof. Musgrave at this point).  The rest of you
decided to have the photos of the painting developed and to arrange
transport to Lesser Edale, to investigate the third newspaper article.

The developed photos proved just as hard to focus on as the original
painting, but Prof. Musgrave really concentrated, and realised that it
was actually two overlapping symbols, which tricked the eye.  The
symbols were:

- An inverted ankh:

  ```asciiart
    |
    |
  --+--
   / \
   \_/
    |
  ```

- A circle with two lines coming off it, like wings:

  ```asciiart
  __     __
   _\   /_
     \_/
     / \
     \_/
  ```

After sunset Wilhelmina and Jason returned to the rear of the Penhew
Foundation.  Jason managed to force the padlock on the back gate,
without breaking it, and you entered the yard.  In the yard Jason
noticed an air intake vent, going underground, at the opposite side of
the building to the coal chute.

You descended the coal chute using a rope tied to a grappling hook,
and found yourselves in a pile of coal.  Using flashlights you could
see that you are in a large basement, approximately half as wide as
the building (though not wide enough to include the air intake vent)
with a low wall separating the coal heap from the main basement, which
contained the boiler.  After stepping over the low wall you could see
an elevator and a staircase up into the main building, and a door.

You listened at the door, and couldn't hear anything.  You opened it
cautiously, and found a storage room full of crates.  The discovered
basement now consisted of an L shape:

```asciiart
 ________
|     .  |
|     .  |
|     ...|
|        |
|        |_______
|        |       |
|                |
|________|_______|
```

The air vent suggested an underground room in the missing area, but
there were no more doors.  You tried to look behind crates against the
back wall of the storage room, but they were flush against the wall.
Quietly, to not alert the night watchman in the rooms above, you moved
some crates.  This revealed a door.

You listened at the door and, again, couldn't hear anything.  However,
this time you were certain that the room was empty.  You opened the
door.

Inside the room your flashlights played over a collection of
unexpected items: high quality furniture, evidently well cared for and
used; strange paintings; books, crates, and an ornate chest.  The air
vent was visible at the far end of the room, as was a ladder into the
main building.

Examining everything in the room, you found:

- A .32 revolver and a box of bullets.
- Several passports, for various genders and nationalities.  None of
  the faces or names were familiar.
- Bundles of five- and ten-pound notes, totalling thousands of pounds.
- A receipt for the rental of a cast iron safe from Ernest Whitfield &
  Co, Birmingham to Henson Manufacturing, Derby.  Strangely, it
  appears to have no connection to the Penhew Foundation.
- A letter from Puneet Chaudhary of Limehouse relating to the
  warehousing and shipping of "sundry antiquities" to Shanghai.
- A business card for Empire Spices in Soho.
- Egyptian-style artwork of strange creatures:
  - A dark winged thing, somehow both leprous and scaly.
  - A winged hulking beast, with a dragon-like tail and a fang-rimmed
    jaw.
  - A group of people with deformed faces and too-large eyes.
  - A man on fire and surrounded by colourful lights, but his features
    shrouded in darkness.
- A large sealed crate addressed to "Ho Fang Import/Export, 15 Kaoyang
  Street, Shanghai, China".
- A smaller sealed crate addressed to "Randolph Shipping Company, Port
  Darwin, Northern Territory, Dominion of Australia".  This crate had
  the winged-circle symbol on it.
- An ornate wooden chest decorated with silver depictions of strange
  creatures that look like a cross between a lizard and an ape with
  too-long arms, which contained two ornate silver daggers.
- Books in many languages.

Not wanting to leave any evidence of your presence, you took
photographs but didn't disturb or take anything.

You then snuck back out of the building and left, locking the gate
behind you.

### 14th of February, 1925

Jason and Wilhelmina finally told Prof. Musgrave that they still
suspected the Penhew Foundation, and asked his opinion on the
paintings, handing him the photos they took.  After spending some
hours in his study, Prof. Musgrave found features in the artwork which
clearly dated it to the Third Dynasty, which is when the Black Pharaoh
is said to have ruled.  Caught up in his research, he almost missed
the train to Derby.

You then all set off for Lesser Edale.


England session 3, 2019-04-13
-----------------------------

### 14th of February, 1925 (mid afternoon)

You arrived in Edale, which is far as the train can take you.  You
walked the five miles to Lesser Edale in a little under two hours,
with rain starting just before you arrived at the village pub, the
Laughing Horse Inn.

Lesser Edale is home to the Vane family, currently presided over by
Lord Arthur Vane.  The Vanes live in Plumb Castle to the north of the
village.  Clarissa knows of them, but has not met them in years.

You quietly asked Bill Tatlock, the landlord, about the recent
murders.  He said that "folk around here don't like to talk about it"
but, with a little encouragement, told you that the murders happened
three months ago during the nights of the full moon.  George Osgood
and Lydia Perkins were killed, Harold Short was attacked but survived,
and has gone to his brother in Skegness.  Constable Tumwell shot a
wild dog, and he thinks the matter is settled, but there have been
strange howls on the nights of the full moon---which starts tomorrow.

You decided to split up and go talk to the families of the victims.
Dr. Crane and Lady Ashdown went to see John Perkins, father of Lydia
Perkins; the rest of you went to see where Harold Short was attacked
and then go on to the Osgood farm.

Dr. Crane knocked on the door, and was answered by John Perkins.
Dr. Crane introduced himself and Clarissa, and upon hearing the title
*Lady* Ashdown, John took a step back in shock and said "Another one!
Come back for more, have you?"  He started ranting about the
unjustness of the British class system and how the Labour party would
put a stop to this[^feb14_1].

[^feb14_1]: The Labour party had experienced a rapid increase in vote
  share since about 1910, which probably contributes to John's high
  hopes.

After several minutes of this, Dr. Crane asked if this was something
to do with Lord Vane (Clarissa was keeping quiet).  You learned that
John thinks that Lawrence Vane, son of Lord Arthur Vane, had something
to do with the death of Lydia, who was found mauled.  Lawrence was
seen nearby on the night of Lydia's death, though "he had no reason to
be here".  The police talked to Lawrence Vane but declared him
innocent, but "the police won't charge these aristocrats".  You also
learned that both Lord Arthur and Lawrence had been away recently,
Lawrence returned six months ago and Lord Arthur three or four.
Although seeming somewhat unhinged, John seemed to believe everything
he said about Lawrence being the culprit (or at least very close to
the culprit).  After managing to extract yourselves from the
conversation, you examined his field where the body had been found,
but found no clues.

Wilhelmina, Prof. Musgrave, and Jason went to Harold Short's house,
but nobody was at home.  You continued on to the Osgood farm, and
there met Edith Osgood, wife of George Osgood.  She said that George
heard a noise in the barn and went to investigate, taking his shotgun
with him.  She heard a shot, and a scream.  She looked out of the
window and saw a hairy form, the height of a man, running away on all
fours into the woods to the north.  "It was a demon", she said.  Upon
mustering her courage, she went to the barn and found the mauled form
of George Osgood.  The sheep in the barn had not been attacked.

You all returned to the pub, where you stayed the night.

### 15th of February, 1925

You decided to pay Lord Vane a visit, and went to Plum Castle first
thing in the morning, leaving your calling cards to request a social
visit.

You visited the police station, which is clearly just a house, but
didn't find anybody in.  You then returned to the pub, and there met
Constable Tumwell, the police force for Lesser Edale.  You asked him
about the murders, and he said that there had been no trouble since he
shot the wild dog, the case is closed in his opinion.  When asked
about the howling he said that there are always wild animals in the
countryside, but these don't seem to be causing any trouble.

You went back to his house to use his phone to ring Harold Short.  You
got in touch with his brother, Thomas Short, who said that Harold
couldn't possibly talk about the events of that night, as he was still
recovering.  You failed to persuade Thomas to tell you any more
details than you already knew.

You then visited the village church.  The church building is quite
new, but the foundations of the old can be seen in the grounds, which
are partly cemetery.  Next to the church is a vicarage.  Inside the
church you found Reverend Jeremy Stratton.

You asked Rev. Stratton about the murders, and he said that he
understood Constable Tumwell had shot a wild dog, and that that seemed
to be the end of it.  Jason could tell he wasn't being entirely
truthful, and that he really didn't think the shooting of the dog had
achieved anything.  Jason hinted at this quite strongly, but
Rev. Stratton simply said that he hopes life in the village can return
to normal.

You then turned to the topic of the Vanes.  Rev. Stratton said that
Lord Arthur spent most of his time in London, taking his role in the
House of Lords very seriously.  In addition to a son, Lawrence, there
is a daughter, Eloise.  Lord Arthur returned about four months ago and
has remained in Lesser Edale to care for Eloise, who has taken ill.
You asked how long ago Eloise fell ill, but the Reverend thought that
you were beginning to pry upon personal matters, and ended the
conversation.

Outside the church, you found a groundskeeper.  Jason approached him
and tried to make conversation, but mostly got grumblings and
laughter.  Nearby you spotted the new graves of George Osgood and
Lydia Perkins, and noticed they had a small silver crucifix over their
headstones.  You asked the groundskeeper about these, and his good
natutre fell away immediately, as he said "these are local matters,
they don't concern outsiders", and turned away.  You pressed him to
continue, and he said "they were murdered by the beast, them
crucifixes will keep 'em down where they belong; don't want 'em
turning", and he stalked off.  Jason tried to get him to say more, but
he wouldn't.

As tonight is the first night of the full moon, you decided to arm
yourselves and go to a high location to try to identify the source of
the howling.  Dr. Crane visited John Perkins and rented three
shotguns.


England session 4, 2019-04-27
-----------------------------

### 15th of February, 1925 (late afternoon)

With not much to do until sunset, you returned to the church to ask if
you could buy any silver crucifixes, like those on the graves.  You
were told no, the silver belongs to the Church and is not for sale.

At sunset you went up a hill, and a little after the moon rose the
howling started.  The sound seemed to be coming from every direction,
echoing so much you couldn't tell if it was one voice or many.
Clarissa recognised the sound from a story she had once heard, about
ghouls: man-sized creatures which eat human flesh.

You decided to walk towards Plum Castle to see if the sound was coming
from there.  The howling steadily got louder as you did.  About half
way between the castle and the village, you found a torn scrap of
frilly cloth, perhaps from a dress.  It had clearly been out in the
elements for a while.

When you arrived at the crumbling outer wall of the castle, you could
tell that the howling was coming from somewhere inside the castle
grounds, on the opposite side of the keep to where you were.  You
snuck around the building, paying close attention to the windows, and
stopped facing the mausoleum.  You could see light reflected on the
ground, a room in the keep had a lighted window.

```asciiart
    x <- you are here
_____
     |                       ___________
     |                      |           |
keep |                      | mausoleum |
     | <- lighted window    |           | <- door
     |                      |           |
```

Wilhelmina crept to the window and listened.  She heard two male
voices, one older and one younger, having some sort of argument.  The
younger said "we can't keep this hidden... this nightly ordeal... we
need help!" the older said "no, we can't involve outsiders."

You snuck across to the mausoleum and around to the big double doors,
which face away from the keep.  You listened, but couldn't hear
anything other than the howling.  You carefully pushed the door open,
and saw just a mausoleum, no movement, no creatures.  The howling
seemed to be coming from a staircase to a lower level.  You descended
it, and saw nothing again---the howling filled the room.

Jason found a loose floor slab, which revealed a narrow man-made shaft
with a rusty ladder, descending into what looked like a natural cave.
You descended, and saw a tunnel.  Clarissa realised the tunnel headed
towards the keep.  You followed it.

You arrived at a brick wall, and the howling was now very loud.

Wilhelmina found a hidden mechanism to open a door in the wall.
Everyone readied their guns.  Wilhelmina flung the door open, but even
as she was opening it the creature burst through: man-tall, with a
dog-like face, grey skin, shaggy hair, and yellow talons.  Dr. Crane
panicked, losing the ability to focus.  Jason fired two shots,
flinging the creature back into the room whence it came.  It didn't
get up.

You saw that the room was a dungeon cell.  When you looked at the
creature again, it had transformed into a young girl, you guessed to
be Eloise Vane, with a gaping wound in her chest from the shotgun
blast.  Dr. Crane rushed into the cell, trying to help the girl, who
was obviously dead.  He began grinding his teeth from stress.

You heard a door opening inside the keep, and rapid footsteps.
Dr. Crane wouldn't leave the girl, and Jason stayed behind with him.
The rest of you fled back through the tunnel.

Two men with shotguns entered, who you guessed to be Arthur and
Lawrence Vane.  When Lawrence saw Eloise, he collapsed to his knees.
Arthur alternately demanded "what have you done?" and "where did you
come from?", gesturing towards the hidden door.  Dr. Crane looked up
sadly and said "the mausoleum", and Arthur sent Lawrence to it after
dragging him to his feet.  Jason tried to reason with Arthur, saying
that it had to be done, that there had been enough death in the
village already, but didn't get through.  Arthur said that you would
be staying there, and left.

Those of you who fled escaped back to your rooms at the pub.

### 16th of February, 1925

Prof. Musgrave, Wilhelmina, and Clarissa planned a rescue operation
for that evening.

In the morning, Dr. Crane and Jason were left alone, though they heard
hammering from the secret passage.  In the afternoon, Arthur and
Lawrence returned.  Jason again tried to persuade Arthur, but is just
told to get back, as Lawrence pointed the gun at you.  Arthur took
Eloise's body, and they left you alone and locked in again.

In the evening, Prof. Musgrave, Wilhelmina, and Clarissa returned to
the mausoleum the way they came.  The door had been boarded shut.
They tried to pull the boards out by hand, but lost their grip and
loudly fell back into a puddle.  A door in the keep opened, and you
managed to hide before Lawrence arrived.  He looked around, but didn't
see anything, and returned to the keep.

You then broke into a garden shed, and found a claw hammer and a
shovel.  You returned to the mausoleum, and removed the wood.  You
reunited with Dr. Crane and Jason, and all travelled cross-country
through the night to Edale, to get the first train back to London.


England session 5, 2019-05-11
-----------------------------

### 17th of February, 1925

You all returned to your homes after travelling through the night, and
made some discoveries: Jason found footprints in the dust, leading to
a window; Arthur found the police at his house, and some of the New
York artefacts stolen.  The feather robe, the wooden mask, and the
wooden sceptre were all taken; other more mundane artefacts in the
same room had not, despite it having been ransacked.  The police
thought that the house had probably been visited multiple times, as
there were multiple signs of entry at different points.  Arthur's wife
had been home during all this, but not discovered anything until the
robbery itself.  You spoke to the neighbours, but they had nothing new
to share.

Carson suffered a hallucination where he thought there was someone
else in his hotel room with him, and turned to see the ghoul form of
Eloise Vane fatally wounded but alive and watching him.  He came to
his senses on a train bound for Southampton, and got off at the next
stop.  He then spent the rest of the day in the local pub
recuperating.

The rest of you systematically examined everyone's homes for signs of
trespass.  At Prof. Musgrave's house you found footprints of multiple
people in the garden, and the same in the gardens of Clarissa's house,
where Jason was staying.  When questioned, Clarissa's butler mentioned
that some "ruffians" had been loitering near the house, and he had
chased them off.  You managed to talk your way into Carson's hotel
room, despite his absence, and found that the tongue-mask hadn't been
taken.  You advised the hotel staff that you had reason to believe
Carson's room could be targeted for a robbery, and that they should
increase security if possible.

Jason spent the rest of the day going through Clarissa's garden trying
to track the footprints, but with no luck.  That evening Jason and a
band of brutish thugs (or possibly thuggish brutes) he managed to
round up from a pub kept an eye on Carson's hotel, but saw nothing.

### 18th of February, 1925

You decided to follow up on the Empire Spices business card you found
in the hidden room of the Penhew Foundation's basement, and went to
visit.  You asked around as you approached, and found that it's a
generally well-regarded shop that gets a lot of custom.  You arrived
at 76 Wardour Street to find a two-storey building full of spices from
all around the globe.  While browsing you talked to Zahra Shafik, the
owner, mentioning you had heard about Empire Spices while at the
Penhew Foundation.  Shafik said that she sometimes helped the
Foundation with expedition preparations, giving advice on local
customs, fashioning introductions to the local authorities, that sort
of thing.  You bought some spices and left.

That evening you decided to go investigate the Shipley house, and find
out what was going on there once and for all.  You arrived to find the
house dark.  As you watched it, you saw Miles leave; Arthur and Carson
followed him into the fog.  The rest of you snuck around the back of
the house to the garden, and picked the lock on the gate.

Miles spotted Arthur and Carson, and then headed into a nearby pub.
They followed him in, and accosted him at the bar, sitting down with
him and drawing him into conversation about his recent work.  He
seemed uncomfortable, but unable to extract himself from the
conversation.

Jason picked the padlock on the trapdoor into the basement, and you
all entered cautiously.  It was messy, with boxes, crates, and old
furniture strewn around.  There was a path through the junk to the
south wall.  Jason spotted the outline of a partially hidden door in
the wall, and opened it by pushing a brick.  The door swung open, with
a cloud of snake-smell pouring out into the basement.  The hidden room
was unoccupied.

The room contained shelves covered with jars, some filled with liquid,
some filled with ground-up solids.  One wall was covered in mystic
symbols.  At the base of another wall was a large stone tub covered
with a metal lid.  Clarissa took some of the jars.  Jason cautiously
removed the lid of the tub and revealed the severed head and butchered
body of a naked woman, covered in large claw marks.


England session 6, 2019-05-25
-----------------------------

### 18th of February, 1925

Clarissa, Jason, and Wilhelmina left the basement and moved onto the
Shipley house.  Jason picked the lock of the back door, and you snuck
into the kitchen.  Wilhelmina crept up the stairs, quickly looking at
the three open bedrooms, still dusty and showing no signs of recent
use, and peered through the lock of the shut one.  She couldn't see or
hear anything.  As Wilhelmina focused on the door, there was a noise
from the attic room[^feb18_1].  Wilhelmina crept back downstairs to
relay her findings.

[^feb18_1]: Where you previously saw Miles' paintings.

You decided to pick the lock on the bedroom door and see what was
inside.  You snuck to the door, and Jason picked the lock.  He
succeeded, but had to force the door as it was stuck on something in
the room.  As soon as he put some strength into it, the door knocked
the obstacle free, and swung open noiselessly.  There were no sounds
from the attic to indicate awareness of you.

You went into the bedroom, shut the door behind you, and took out
torches.  You saw Miles' clothes, scattered around.  Inside the closet
you found a fancy wooden box containing a syringe and a vial of
greenish liquid.  The syringe had been used so much that it was
stained where it had been repeatedly filled up to.  You took the box,
and decided to lure Bertha out of the attic so you could see what she
was doing in there.

Wilhelmina went back downstairs and made a loud noise by banging some
pans together, before running out through the back door.  Bertha
shouted "Miles, is that you?" and left the attic.  Jason and Clarissa
quickly went up the stairs.  They found a padlocked cabinet, its door
open, in the middle of the room.  Inside the cabinet was an incredibly
realistic painting, clearly Miles' masterpiece.  You grabbed the
painting and headed back down to the first floor, and escaped through
a bedroom window onto the street.  Rather than wait around for Bertha
to realise that she had been robbed, you fled back to Clarissa's home.

Some time later Arthur and Carson returned, Miles having extracted
himself from the conversation at last.

### 19th of February, 1925

Around noon you all met up at Clarissa's home, Carson nursing a bad
hangover.  You decided to send the police an anonymous tip about the
body you found in the basement of the Shipley house, and then set to
examining your findings.  Carson looked at the greenish liquid, but
hadn't seen or heard of anything like it before.  Clarissa sent a
servant to catch a rat, and Carson measured out a small dosage.

When the servant returned with the rat, Carson took out a notebook,
and injected the rat with the liquid.  The rat stood still, eyes
bulging, looking around.  It remained that way for about half an hour,
before returning to normal with no apparent side-effects from its
temporary paralysis.

While Carson was observing the rat, Arthur and Clarissa examined the
painting.  Jason averted his gaze.  Despite being clearly incomplete,
it was incredibly realistic, even by Miles' usual standard.  The
painting depicted a swampy area filled with serpents and humanoid
lizards.  In the middle of the swamp was an island with an altar on
it.  The swamp was surrounded by ancient plants which Arthur
identified as being the extinct flora of the Permian era[^feb19_1].
As you looked at the painting, the figures on it seemed to move
purposefully, though you couldn't tell what they were doing.

[^feb19_1]: 300 to 250 million years ago.

After the rat recovered, Carson judged that the drug must be some sort
of hallucinogenic.  Clarissa volunteered to try the drug.  After
laying her down on a sofa, Carson measured out a half dose and
injected her.

Clarissa felt her viewpoint rapidly pulled backwards out of her body,
which she could no longer feel.  She found herself in Egypt in front
of a pyramid, and felt as if she had travelled in time.  She saw five
Europeans entering the pyramid, and she followed them.  She recognised
them as the members of the Carlyle expedition.  Her vision blurred,
and the people were gone.  She felt as if she had travelled in time
again.  She felt like she wasn't alone, as if some presence were aware
of her and watching her, and this presence felt amusement at this.
She was pulled upwards, through the rock of the pyramid, into the sky.
She saw a great shadow covering the land, and turned to see the sun
being eclipsed.  She was pulled up into space.  She saw a burst of
light from the ground, and a rocket climbing towards her.  The rocket
passed her and, as the eclipse became total, exploded.  Despite now
being in space she felt a shockwave pass through her.  A great
triangular rent appeared in space, somehow blacker than the
surrounding space.  Inside the rent was a sole red star, which felt
malevolent.  Clarissa was drawn towards the red star and as she was
about to pass through the triangular rent, awoke in hysterics.  An
hour and a half had passed.

Unable to calm her down, Carson gave her a sedative, and she slept for
a few more hours.  After waking up she shared the vision, and you
realised it had similarities with Roger Carlyle's vision which he
described to Robert Huston.

### 20th of February to 3rd of March, 1925

I suggested you make an **Idea Roll** to pick up on a missed
opportunity for investigation.

Retracing your steps, going over your clues again, and trying to work
out where you should go next, you realised that, despite the
suspicious nature of Edward Gavigan and the Penhew Foundation, you
hadn't done anything more than break in and explore.  So you decided
to take turns watching Gavigan and the Foundation.

After several days you knew that Gavigan was a man of habit.  He
arrived at the Foundation at the same time every morning.  He went out
for lunch to the same place every day at the same time.  He left the
Foundation and went to one of a handful of restaurants at the same
time every evening, before then going home.

One day he did something different.  At lunch time he headed not
towards his usual restaurant, but towards Wembley.  Clarissa was
watching at the time, and followed him to the British Empire
Exhibition.

Gavigan met a woman wearing a headscarf who Clarissa realised was
Zahra Shafik, owner of Empire Spices.  Unable to get close enough to
hear the full conversation, Clarissa only received these snippets:

- "friends of that irritating journalist"
- "they came to the shop"
- "shame, I have the greatest respect for him professionally, but"
- "my sources say they were in New York"
- "break in at the Foundation"
- "they can't be allowed to interfere with the shipments"

They then parted ways.  Clarissa informed the rest of you, and you
promptly decided to interfere with the shipments, assuming this
related to the crates addressed to Australia and Shanghai you found in
the secret room in the Penhew Foundation basement.

### 3rd of March to 9th of March, 1925

Figuring that a truck would arrive at the Foundation at some point to
collect the crates, you kept up your watch.  One night when Arthur was
watching, this happened.  He followed the truck to a warehouse in
Limehouse, and paid a street urchin to go and tell the rest of you
where he had gone.  Arthur entered the warehouse and asked the owner,
Puneet Chaudhary, about shipments from the Penhew Foundation.
Chaudhary said that he had been warehousing things for the Foundation
for a while, and that the shipping was done by a vessel called the
Ivory Wind, currently docked in the Regent's Canal Dock and due to set
sail in a few days.

Arthur left the warehouse, by which time the rest of you had arrived.
You went to the dock and found the ship, where a crew member said that
the captain was at the pub.  You went to the local pub and found him,
Lars Torvak, a heavily drinking Norwegian man.

You asked about booking travel to Shanghai.  Lars was surprised by
this, saying that his ship doesn't normally carry passengers, but you
said that there were people you wanted to keep out of the sight of.
He agreed to take you.  You then asked about his shipments, and if you
could inspect them.  You failed to persuade him, and he said "I'll
pretend I didn't hear that."

### 11th of March, 1925

A few days later the Ivory Wind set sail, with you aboard.

### End

This is the end of this chapter.  Bonus sanity points are:

- `+1d6` for putting an end to the happenings in the Shipley house.
- `-1d3` for killing Eloise Vane and making an enemy of Lord Arthur.

The next chapter will begin with you arriving in Shanghai.


China session 1, 2019-06-08
---------------------------

It was a bright and sunny morning on the day the Ivory Wind set sail.
The ship, fully loaded with cargo; your belongings, stored in the
passenger rooms which the crew had, grumbling at the orders of the
captain, vacated; and you, standing on the deck watching the crew and
the dock workers make their final preparations.

As you watched, a dense fog started to pour out from the city,
creeping across the ground.  The fog hadn't quite reached the ship
when Captain Torvak gave the order to set sail.  As the ship pulled
off into the Thames, the fog rushed towards it, as if driven by a
gale, but there was only a light wind.  The fog piled up obscuring the
city from view, towering over the ship, but stopped when it reached
the water.  The breeze brought you the faint smell of burning hair.

You sailed down the Thames with a wall of fog on each bank.  Captain
Torvak said he'd never seen weather like it.  Carson swore he saw the
fog moving purposefully, following you.  The Ivory Wind made it out
into the sea, leaving London and its fogs and cults behind.

The crossing took the best part of two months, with the ship stopping
to exchange cargo in Marseilles, Malta, Port Said, Aden, Bombay,
Singapore, and finally Shanghai.

It wasn't exactly a luxury crossing, but you all relaxed and
recuperated as best you could during the long voyage.

Clarissa spent most of her time studying the book **Africa's Dark
Sects**, which you found at the Ju-Ju House in New York.  Sometimes
several days went by with her staying locked up in her room.  Some
mornings she would come for breakfast tired and bleary eyed, then
return to her room to spend the day sleeping.  The book goes into
great and gory detail about the ritual practices of various cults,
including human sacrifice, and Clarissa finished her study certain
that there was still more to learn from the tome.

<aside class="highlight">

This ritual was used by a particularly bloodthirsty tribe, the Kikuyu.
The same tribe which is blamed for killing the members of the Carlyle
Expedition.  As she read the description of the undead servants,
Clarissa couldn't help but be reminded of the four mutilated people in
the basement of the Ju-Ju House.

---

You came to Shanghai following the lead of some crates in a hidden
basement in the Penhew Foundation, which were addressed to Ho Fang
Import/Export, Shanghai.  But that isn't the only time you've seen
mention of China in your investigation.  Jackson Elias' Nairobi notes
say that he met a man who claimed to have met Jack Brady, Roger
Carlyle's bodyguard, in Hong Kong well after the Kenyan courts had
declared the entire expedition dead.

Shanghai in 1925 is a divided city.  There's the old walled Chinese
city itself; to the west is the French Concession; and to the north is
the Shanghai International Settlement, ruled by the British and the
Americans.  Chinese law doesn't apply to the French Concession or the
International Settlement.  Outside of the International Settlement,
most people don't speak fluent, or any, English.  Citizens of the US,
Mexico, and most European colonial powers are immune to Chinese law
even in the old city and can only be tried under the laws of their
respective states, a fact the native Chinese are not fond of.  Despite
the strong western control over Shanghai, Chinese make up the vast
majority of the population.  Of the 1.6 million inhabitants, only
20,000 are non-Chinese, and most of those are Japanese.  The
westerners tend to either be incredibly wealthy businessmen, or
undocumented immigrants trying to eke out a living where they can.
The national government has little authority, and the city is largely
ruled by gangs.  Buildings have high walls and barred windows.
Everyone who is anyone employs guards.  And the wealthy walk the
streets in shabby clothes to hide their status. The currency is the
yuan, which is used interchangeably with the Mexican silver dollar.
One US dollar is worth two yuan.

After spiriting you and his cargo through customs with suspicious
ease, Captain Torvak introduced you to Li Wen-Cheng, a young man with
a very western outlook.  At the captain's recommendation you employed
him as a comprador, a kind of assistant to help you interact with the
locals.  You have him at your disposal, though he's not spending every
waking moment with you.  He can usually be found at the Methodist
University if you need him.  He can help if you want to interact with
anyone who doesn't know English, which will be most of the Chinese who
don't regularly work with westerners, and with providing general
information and gossip about the city.

---

It's now the morning of the 4th of May.  You've been in Shanghai for a
few days, enough time to get your bearings, find lodgings in a hotel
on the outskirts of the International Settlement, and send an update
on your investigation to Carlton Ramsey.  What do you do?

### 4th of May, 1925

You wanted to hire some guards, so Li Wen-Cheng took you all (except
Arthur who didn't want to go) to the Stumbling Tiger Bar, which has a
reputation of being a place where you can acquire anything you need:
items, people, and information.  The Stumbling Tiger Bar is in a
district of bars, gambling dens, and flower girl houses[^flower_girl].
Opening the door to the bar released a wall of cigarette smoke.  The
inside was busy, filthy, and Carson couldn't help but think of the
risks of tuberculosis as he entered.  There you met the bartender
Fergus Chum---polishing a glass with a surprisingly clean rag---a
mixed race man who greeted you warmly and asked you to call him
"McChum".  You asked about hiring thuggish brutes (brutish thugs?) and
he said he knew some guys.  You negotiated a week-long contract at a
day rate of $3, open to renegotiation at the end of the week; they
will meet you at your hotel tomorrow morning.

[^flower_girl]: A flower girl house is a place where pretty girls
  entertain men.  It's not necessarily a brothel, but many of the
  girls do have sex with their customers for money.

Jason had the idea of asking McChum, an information broker, if he knew
anything about Jack Brady.  McChum said he didn't know the name.
Carson spotted this was a lie and signalled Jason.  Jason discretely
passed over some money to help jog McChum's memory, and he confessed
that he did know Jack Brady and told you that Brady had gone to
contact Charlie Grey, a "big money man" in Rangoon, to conduct some
business involving guns.  Jason realised that this story was only a
partial truth but didn't press for more.

While Jason and McChum were engaged in conversation, Carson looked
around the bar at the other patrons.  Carson's attention was caught by
a very drunk-looking man, but Carson noticed his actions didn't seem
quite right.  His motor skills and reactions weren't uniformly
degraded, and he managed to spill much more than he drank.  The man
was only pretending to be drunk.  Carson asked McChum who the man was.
McChum said he was a regular customer, some sort of foreman involved
in a construction project.

You all wanted some weapons, so Carson asked Li Wen-Cheng if there was
a gun shop nearby, and went off to do some shopping.  He bought enough
for a small army, and eventually headed back to the hotel.

Jason, Wilhelmina, and Clarissa kept an eye on the drunk guy for hours
but he didn't leave.  Eventually they went back to the hotel to meet
Carson.

While this was going on, Arthur went to visit a buddhist temple.
While there he found an advert for Mr Lung's horoscopes and fortune
telling, which he decided to go check out.

Arthur found the small house on Kaoyang Street.  Its bright red door
smelled of wet paint.  On either side of the door were wooden plaques
with stylised symbols based on Chinese script.  Outside the door sat a
Siamese cat meowing loudly.  Arthur knocked on the door, but got no
response.  He peered through the window and saw a man, he caught the
man's attention and knocked again.

The door opened slowly to reveal a man wearing a bright purple hat and
robe.  Arthur introduced himself, and asked if the man was Mr. Lung.
He assented, and opened the door further.  The cat dashed in.  Arthur
stepped through the door, which seemed to astonish Mr. Lung.
Immediately inside the door was a screen obscuring the rest of the
home, and many hanging amulets.  Mr. Lung keenly showed the amulets to
Arthur and asked his opinion.  Arthur was polite.  Beyond the screen,
the furniture of the home was scattered across the floor, blocking the
path, and had to be climbed over.  Arthur could tell that there was
some organisation to the furniture, but couldn't tell what it was.  As
he clambered over the furniture, Mr. Lung again looked astonished.
Mr. Lung then showed Arthur some scrolls decorated with tigers.
Arthur was polite again.  The cat was still nowhere to be seen.

Mr. Lung then gestured to a room and said that he did his work in his
office, and invited Arthur in.  As soon as Arthur had stepped through
the door, Mr. Lung dashed out and slammed it shut.  The door was
locked.  The room contained a desk, on which was a pile of money and a
box of matches.  The walls were covered in black drapes embroided with
stars and representations of the Chinese zodiac.  The drapes were
lumpy as if they covered something.  Arthur moved one of the drapes,
and they all fell to the floor.  The walls were covered in dozens of
mirrors.  Arthur immediately began to feel ill, and he realised what
was going on.  Everything Mr. Lung had showed him was some protection
against demons in Chinese mythology, and mirrors were the most potent
of all.  Despite not being a demon, Arthur felt very affected by the
mirrors.

<aside class="highlight">
Arthur loses 5 POW.
</aside>

Arthur tried to force the door.  He failed, and smashed some of the
mirrors, before deciding to cover himself with the drapes.  Once out
of sight of the mirrors, Arthur felt better again.  He then heard the
cat yowling from the other room.  Suddenly there was a loud roar, and
Mr. Lung screamed.  A while later Mr. Lung, covered in scratches and
bruises, opened the door and said "so you weren't the demon after
all..." before collapsing onto Arthur.  Arthur managed to get him to
say where the nearest apothecary was, and half carried Mr. Lung to get
medical treatment.  Arthur looked for the cat, but it had vanished.
As Mr. Lung calmed down, he managed to explain that he had foretold
that a demon would come to him today, and that he assumed it was
Arthur.

Impressed by seeing Mr. Lung's genuine power, the power to banish a
demon, Arthur was keen to get his horoscope foretold.  Mr. Lung was
only too happy to oblige, and told Arthur that he was only part way
through a long journey with more still to come; that there would be
terrible things man was not meant to see; and to beware of seafood.

Arthur then asked Mr. Lung if he knew anything about Ho Fang, whose
warehouse is on the same street.  Mr. Lung said that Ho Fang is a
powerful businessman, and not the sort of person you want to get on
the wrong side of.  There are rumours he's involved in smuggling; but
in the import/export business who isn't?  Arthur decided to go check
out the warehouse.

Ho Fang's warehouse is a large building by a pier on the banks of the
Whangpoo River.  At the front looks like offices, and around the back
is the warehouse proper.  The warehouse itself has six huge doors,
open at this hour, with people coming to and fro.  All the windows
were high off the ground and barred.  Arthur then returned to the
hotel.

After everyone met back up in the hotel, and Arthur recounted the
story of his terrible day, Wilhelmina and Jason decided to head back
out to have a look at the warehouse.  It was locked up by the time
they arrived, with the large doors shut.  They noticed that the
warehouse was partially built over the pier, and it looked like a
small boat could fit beneath it at low tide.  They suspected that this
was used for transporting items Ho Fang wanted to keep hidden.

On their way back to the hotel they went to the Stumbling Tiger Bar,
and saw that the drunk foreman had left.

### 5th of May, 1925

You decided to look into all of your leads simultaneously: find a way
to contact Charlie Grey, get a boat to investigate the bit of Ho
Fang's warehouse which extends over the pier, and follow the
pretending-to-be-drunk guy from the Stumbling Tiger Bar.

Arthur went to the British Consulate to follow up on Charlie Grey, as
they're probably a British or American citizen.  He found contact
details for a Charles Grey Ltd. registered in Rangoon and sent a
telegram asking about Jack Brady.  Meanwhile, Carson went to rent a
small boat.

You then waited until the evening.

Jason and Wilhelmina went to the bar, keeping a low profile while
watching the foreman.  Eventually he waved goodbye to his companions
and stumbled out into the crowd.  You followed him.  Even thought it
was now night, the narrow streets were still packed, and staying out
of sight wasn't difficult.  As he got further from the bar, he
appeared to sober up---far too quickly for actual drunkeness.  When he
reached a quieter area, he stopped and looked around before turning
down a side street, but you managed to duck out of sight.  You caught
up and followed him to his hotel.

Wilhelmina distracted the one receptionist up at this hour, while
Jason carefully followed the man to his room.  Through the closed
door, Jason heard conversation in Japanese, and the name "Jack Brady".

Jason and Wilhelmina then went to meet up with everyone else at the
boat, and sailed beneath the pier.  Above you, in the floor of the
warehouse, was a pair of large metal doors with no obvious lock or
mechanism.  You all strained with crowbars, but failed to shift them.
Jason decided to try breaking in through the front and finding a way
to open the doors from the inside.

Jason picked the lock of the front door and entered the office part at
the front of the building.  Jason found himself in a small entrance
hall connected to a corridor, with stairs going up at one end and
offices at the other.  Through the wall from the direction of the
warehouse he could hear voices.  Jason had a look at the offices, but
found nothing interesting.  He started climbing the stairs, and
stopped when he noticed a loose stair which would probably make a
noise when he stood on it.  He pried the board up, and saw that it
gave access to the ceiling of a room directly above where the boat
was.  Jason climbed down into the room, which was separated from the
main warehouse by a large sealed door.

The room had two large, padlocked, metal doors in the floor, with a
winch mechanism above them.  The room also had a lot of strange items
and many crates: several statues of different sizes of a large bloated
woman with tentacles emerging from her flesh; a bronze vessel used in
ancestor rituals (Jason had seen such a thing before in the British
Museum while in London), with carvings of strange beasts; and a
display case containing several large bones, labelled "dragon bones".

Jason turned his attention to the doors in the floor, and managed to
break the locks, allowing the others into the room.  After examining
everything, you decided to take one of the bloated woman statues and
open some of the crates.  There was no obvious sign of the crates sent
from the Penhew Foundation, most of the crates were labelled "A.P.".
You remembered that "A.P." are the initials of Sir Aubrey Penhew.  You
opened a crate, and found a very strange and intricate looking
mechanism.  You decided to take that too.  You opened an unlabelled
crate, and found large, baggy, black and yellow robes.  You took some
of those too.

You lowered your spoils into the boat.  Then Jason and Wilhelmina
decided to go explore upstairs while the rest of you waited quietly.


China session 2, 2019-06-23
---------------------------

You've come to Shanghai, following the lead of some crates addressed
to Ho Fang Import/Export which you found in a hidden cultist basement
of the Penhew Foundation in London.  You've learned that Ho Fang is
powerful, involved with smuggling, and definitely not the sort of
person you want to get on the wrong side of.  You've also found signs
of Jack Brady, Roger Carlyle's bodyguard and surviving member of the
Carlyle Expedition.

Last session you found a secret smuggler's entrance to Ho Fang's
warehouse, accessible at low tide, and broke in at night.  You found
some strange things: statues of bloated, tentacled, women; black and
yellow robes; and intricate machine parts.  It's now well after
midnight, Jason and Wilhelmina have gone to explore the upstairs of
the warehouse offices, while the rest of you wait below in your boat.

### 5th of May, 1925 (night)

Jason and Wilhelmina crept upstairs and found a large, plainly
decorated, office.  Jason looked through a ledger on the desk and
found some non-Chinese names and destinations: Omar al-Shakti (Cairo),
Ahja Singh (Mombasa), Randolph Shipping Company (Port Darwin).  The
entries mostly mentioned antiques, art, and books, however the
Randolph Shipping Company seemed to be handling a lot of mining
equipment.  Wilhelmina looked through the filing cabinets and found
more papers with those names on, though the papers themselves were in
Chinese.

The room also contained many large rolled-up navigational charts.
Jason realised one was less dusty than the rest and, figuring that it
was frequently used, took some photos.  The map was for Gray Dragon
Island, a volcanic island with some sort of large cave inside the
volcano, 300 miles to the south.

You then heard movement downstairs.  Wilhelmina peered down the
stairs, and saw that the coast was clear.  You both crept back down to
the room with the hidden door, took the dragon bones, and got back
into the boat.

As you sailed away, you saw a face watching you from the shadows on
the riverbank.

Hoping to avoid being followed back to your hotel, you got off the
boat sooner than you had planned, and took a circuitous route.  You
didn't see anyone following you, and returned to the hotel safely.

You decided to wake up Prof. Musgrave and ask if he'd seen anything
like these dragon bones before.  He said bones were a bit out of his
area of expertise, but he would have a look.  Musgrave said that the
bones were from something larger than a human, though he's not sure
what, and they were an unusual shade of grey.

You also examined more closely the mechanical parts you took, but
nobody could even guess what they could be for.

### 6th of May, 1925

Prof. Musgrave woke up first, and sat in the hotel cafe eating
breakfast while reading the Shanghai Courier, a dual-language
newspaper.  The front-page story was about the Seamen's Club being
attacked and partially destroyed last night by "strange creatures"
which came from the river, though officials who had inspected the
damage thought it was due to seepage undermining the ground.  Another
short story talked about "yet another" murder where the victim had had
their arms cut off and left to bleed out.  There are rumours of a
madman, and the police haven't found the perpetrator yet.

While Musgrave was reading, the thuggish brutes you'd hired from
Fergus Chum arrived.  With their poor English, and the aid of the
hotel receptionist, they conveyed that they had been hired as
protection.

Eventually, everyone but Wilhelmina had woken up, come down to
breakfast, and found Musgrave sitting in the middle of five
mean-looking thugs.  You decided to go to the university to do some
research and to see if the engineering or physics department could
tell you what the machine parts you found were.

Musgrave, Clarissa, and the thuggish brutes went to the library.
Musgrave asked the librarian for anything they had about Gray Dragon
Island in English, and received some navigational charts with basic
factual information: it's a small volcanic island in such a
strategically useless position that no country has claimed ownership
of it.  He satisfies the staff of his academic credentials and gets a
library card.  Clarissa found a book on the history of religion in
Shanghai, in Chinese.  Musgrave found a book about local folklore,
also in Chinese.

Jason and Carson met up with Li Wen-Cheng and went to the engineering
department.  They managed to persuade the receptionist how important
it was to speak with the head of the department, and made an
appointment for that afternoon.  They then went to the library to pass
the time.

Li Wen-Cheng translated fragments of the books Musgrave and Clarissa
had checked out:

- Gray Dragon Island is called that because it was once an active
  volcano.  The last eruption killed all the inhabitants, and the
  island is still uninhabited.  It hasn't been active for centuries.

- A god in the form of a bloated, tentacled, woman was once worshipped
  by the Cult of the Bloated Woman.  The cult had a presence all over
  China, but was concentrated in Shanghai with a few hundred members.
  The cult was secretive about its practices and beliefs, but it was
  known to have connections to the criminal underworld.  It gradually
  died out and isn't thought to exist in the modern day.

Jason, Carson, and Li Wen-Cheng went to their meeting with the head of
the engineering department.  He was stumped by the device, and guessed
that it could be part of some control system, but he really doesn't
know.  He asked where you got it, you blatantly lied, and he didn't
press the matter.  He said that the device is very advanced, and
suggested that it could possibly be from some sort of military
research.

Meanwhile, Wilhelmina woke up and found you gone.  She read the
Shanghai Courier, and figured you had probably gone to investigate the
Seamen's Club, which is where she went.  The entire side of the
building facing the river had collapsed, and the area was cordoned off
with a few spectators, both Chinese and European.

One of the spectators was a German sailor who had been at the club
during the attack.  He said he saw the creatures, and described them
as "fish men".  He said they seemed to be searching for something, but
whatever it was they returned to the river empty-handed.

Wilhelmina asked if anyone unusual had been staying at the club.  He
said that there had been an American, who gave the name John Smith,
who arrived last week and left the day before the attack.  The
American was tall and muscular, with short hair.  Didn't talk much,
and kept to himself.  Wilhelmina took the German's contact details.

Wilhelmina then visited the port authority to check if any ships
matched with the dates John Smith stayed at the club.  She found that
the only non-Chinese and non-Japanese ship to arrive on the right day
was a British yacht called The Dark Mistress[^may6_1] registered to an
Alfred Penhurst, with contact c/o Ho Fang Import/Export[^may6_2].

You realised that this was probably the ship in the photo you found in
Jackson Elias' room back in New York.

[^may6_1]: You all thought that name was really suspicious, but it's
  not necessarily so.  Shakespeare wrote some sonnets about his "Dark
  Mistress", and using the name for a ship is not unheard of.

[^may6_2]: The crates with the machine parts in Ho Fang's warehouse
  were labelled "A.P."

While travelling back from the university, you realised you were being
followed.  To try to catch your tail off guard, you headed to a
quieter area, and everyone but Musgrave hid after turning a corner
into an alley.  Three people arrived at the head of the alley, and
stopped when they saw Musgrave alone.  You managed to surround the
three, and asked who had sent them.  One said they served a powerful
mistress.  As you were trying to interrogate them, Musgrave noticed
that five more people, with guns, were approaching from the other end
of the alley, and you all ran off.

You met back up with Wilhelmina at the hotel, and decided to move to
another hotel.  You went to one deeper in the International
Settlement.

You decided to visit Gray Dragon Island, and figured it would take a
day or two to get there, depending on weather.  You went to the docks
to hire a ship and crew, but didn't have much luck.  All the captains
refused you.  They said that the last few ships which tried to go to
Gray Dragon Island have all disappeared.  A man from one of the ships
got rescued at sea, he said that as they approached the island the
weather suddenly turned violent and sunk the ship.

Your queries were overheard by a man who introduced himself as Chu
Min, and said he would take you.  You asked if he was worried like the
other captains, but he said that that was just superstitious nonsense,
and that with charts and a good crew you can sail any waters.

Jason and Wilhelmina were suspicious of Chu Min.  They decided to take
him to the pub to "celebrate" their meeting, to get him drunk, and to
then follow him and try to learn what his deal is.  Jason asked about
Chu Min's background, Chu Min said that he had been a policeman, and
turned to the sea when he couldn't take it anymore; Jason could tell
he was lying about something.  They drank for a few hours in the pub,
and eventually Chu Min got up to leave.  Jason and Clarissa followed a
few minutes later, but Chu Min had disappeared.

---------------------------

**I didn't get around to writing up proper notes, so here are bullet
points.**

You're setting out to Gray Dragon Island, following a map you found in
Ho Fang's office.  By a stroke of luck, after all the other captains
refused to take you, you encountered the willing Chu Min.  So far
during your short stay in Shanghai you've been watched, followed, and
threatened.  You've hired thugs, followed signs of the cult to Ho
Fang, and found signs of Aubrey Penhew and Jack Brady.  Now you're
leaving it all behind, at least for a few days.  It's now the morning
of the 7th of May, and you and your brutish thugs have just arrived at
the docks.

### 7th of May, 1925

- Met Chu Min at the docks and sailed off
- After three hours the ship turned east, which is not the direction
  of Gray Dragon Island
- Investigators went, with thugs, to ask Chu Min what was going on
- Chu Min tells the investigators they're taking a diversion, not
  going to Gray Dragon Island today, and suggests that they have a
  talk.  He suggests the brutish thugs leave them because "you don't
  know who else's pocket they're in"
- Investigators refuse to send away the brutish thugs.  Chu Min
  shrugs.
- Chu Min asks about their business in Shanghai and why they want to
  go to Gray Dragon Island.  Not a popular destination with tourists.
  He also asked if they knew why they were being followed by Ho Fang,
  Lin Yenyu, and Isoge Taro.
- Investigators open up, seeing that Chu Min knows too much to
  deceive.
- Investigators question Chu Min, who tells them about Firm Action.
- Chu Min signals one of his staff, who operates a radio.  Chu Min
  says that there is someone they should meet, his boat will be here
  soon.  To go to the deck, and this time he really insists that they
  leave the brutish thugs behind.
- After 15 minutes of waiting, an old fishing boat approaches.  On the
  deck is a white man.
- The white man crosses over and has a brief conversation with Chu Min
  out of hearing.
- He turns to the investigators and introduces himself as Jack Brady.
  Jack suggests they get on his boat and accompany him to his base, to
  talk about Gray Dragon Island and his plans.
- During the journey Jack Brady tells his story.
- At the warehouse Jack Brady tells his plans and about the Eye of
  Light and Darkness and invites the investigators along.  He doesn't
  reveal who is doing the translation.  He tells the investigators to
  lay low and not attract further attention.  The investigators ask
  why they are being followed by Lin Yenyu and Isoge Taro.
- When the investigators leave they see some people watching the
  warehouse.  They return to tell Jack Brady, who reveals they are
  Firm Action members.

### 8th of May, 1925

- Investigators go to Shanghai Courier offices and find other
  articles.
- Lantern Street: track down the girl to the hospital but do not go to
  where Chong Mei-Ling has been sold.  Learn about the European.
- Chin-Ling Road: ask the bonze about the monks and the European, if
  he knew why they were meeting.  He did not.  Tracked down Liu
  Chen-dai, he lied out of embarrassment about what he saw.  Checked
  the weather forecast and saw it was poor conditions for a moving
  fire that day (damp and no wind).
- Staked out the docks for the Dark Mistress, which arrived after a
  few days.


China session 4, 2019-08-03
---------------------------

Last session you met Jack Brady, who told you what he knows, and his
plans to render Gray Dragon Island unusable to the cult by means of a
ritual he is having translated.  He offered to bring you along as part
of his strike force when he makes his move.

While you wait for him to contact you again, you've been keeping a
watch on the docks for Sir Aubrey Penhew's yacht, the Dark Mistress.
Tonight, it has arrived.

It is now the night of the 17th of May 1925, 10 days after you met
Jack Brady, and you're all concealed in the shadows watching The Dark
Mistress dock.

What do you do?

### 17th of May, 1925

You watched the crew disembark, you couldn't make out their features
in the darkness, but you saw six tall well-built men, and one shorter
and thinner man.  Judging by the size of the yacht, this would quite
possibly be the total number of crew.  The six well-built men set off
in the direction of Ho Fang's warehouse.  The thin man lit a match for
his pipe, and you saw his face.

The man's skin was sagging, like a sack draped over a frame, his nose
was partially eaten away, his eyes yellow, and he had bald patches.
Carson recognised these as the symptoms of long-term exposure to a
low-intensity source of radiation.

The man didn't seem to be moving from near the ship, so Wilhelmina
decided to try to swim across to it and climb aboard without being
seen.  However the man heard her get into the water, and she decided
to change tack to acting as a diversion, and started shouting "help,
I've fallen in the water!"  When the man went to investigate, Jason
dashed across the dock and into the yacht.

Jason explored the interior of the ship, finding the luxurious guest
rooms, and the less luxurious crew rooms.  The ship's hold was empty,
other than a few expected items like spare ropes and tools.  There
were no other crew.  In a lounge, Jason found a bloated woman statue
in a display cabinet, along with books on astronomy, astrology,
science, and engineering.  In an locked, opulent, bedroom (the only
locked room on the ship), Jason found a booby-trapped wooden cabinet
containing five cylindrical ivory cases, a book **True Magick**, some
particularly ornate cult robes, and a medallion bearing Chinese
characters.

Jason then left the ship.  Wilhelmina had persuaded the thin man to
take her to a nearby bar to dry off near the fireplace.  Everyone
returned to the hotel.

Musgrave examined the ivory cases, and found they contained scrolls
written in Chinese, and worked out they must be over 2,000 years old.
Musgrave also examined the **True Magick** book, which had been
rebound in red silks bearing Chinese-style mythological creatures, and
worked out that it would be from about the 17th century.

You decided to go see Mr. Lung the following day, to see if he could
translate the scrolls or tell you anything about the medallion.

### 18th of May, 1925

You went to see Mr. Lung.  You showed him one of the scrolls, and
after examining it for a while he said that this was only part of a
collection.  You gave him the rest of the scrolls, and with some
difficulty he figured out their order as well as their general topic:
lost ancient continents.  He said that a translation would be
difficult, because the language had changed a lot since the scrolls
were written, he estimated three or four weeks.  Musgrave paid him a
generous retainer, and asked him to work on the translation.  You then
took out the medallion, at which Mr. Lung drew back and became clearly
uncomfortable.  When pressed, he explained that those were the
characters of the Cult of the Bloated Woman, of which he knew a
little.  He then told you more or less what you already knew from the
library.  He said the medallion was a bad omen.

You then went to a cafe to get some lunch.  While you were there, Jack
Brady arrived, to tell you that everything was ready and to come to
the warehouse.  He disappeared as suddenly as he had arrived.

You went to the Firm Action warehouse, and were shown to Jack Brady's
office.  Inside the office were Jack Brady, Chu Min, the "drunken"
Japanese man from the Stumbling Tiger Bar, and an old man wearing
traditional clothing you didn't know.  Jack Brady introduced the old
man as Mu Hsien, the translator.  He introduced the Japanese man as
Captain Isoge Taro of the Imperial Japanese Navy, who had agreed to
help out.

Jack outlined the situation.  The good news is that the ritual has
been translated[^may18_1], the bad news is that Firm Action spies had
reported significantly increased cult activity on the island.  It
seems they were planning to do something big in the next few days,
involving a device Aubrey Penhew has been constructing in the volcano,
and so Jack didn't want to wait.  He said that this could be a
blessing in disguise though, as with so many people---some
white---many of whom have never met before it should be fairly easy to
slip in with disguises.

[^may18_1]: You got a copy as a handout.

He outlined his plan.  Jack would lead a team of Firm Action members
to the opposite side of the volcano to the village, where they would
perform the ritual.  This would last all night.  You would infiltrate
the volcano base and disable the device and, if possible, kill Aubrey
Penhew.  Isoge Taro would call down a naval bombardment on the island
after you had had time to reach the volcano, to cause panic.

At this point Isoge Taro interrupted, and clarified that he didn't
believe in any of this magic business, but that he had seen plans
stolen by the Firm Action spies, and agreed that some sort of weapon
was being constructed.  He said that the Imperial Japanese Navy could
not allow a weapon installation in the South China Sea, and that is
the only reason he is involved.

In the early evening you embarked on the day-long journey to Gray
Dragon Island.

### 19th of May, 1925

As you approach the island, Jack's ship changed course to approach the
far side of the volcano, leaving you by yourselves.  During the
journey Clarissa read **True Magick**.

Your ship pulled up to a rickety wooden pier, where a few other boats
were tied up.  The island was not a welcoming sight: mostly cinders,
sand, and stunted palm trees.  Steam vents dotted the ground.  You
looked up and could see the volcano cone, towering above the rest of
the island.

You went towards the village, and saw a dismal collection of thatched
huts huddling together beneath the trees.  A few villagers milled
around.  You saw a group of a dozen or so cultists heading up the path
to the volcano, and followed them.

You followed the twisting trail about 50m up to an entrance in the
side of the volcano.  The entrance was decorated with the Order's
characters.  The entrance lead to a long stone staircase, descending
another 70m.  The staircase lead to a large open chamber, full of
activity.

The chamber was packed with dozens of people.  It was a rough cylinder
50m high, tapering to a hole through which you could see the sky.  The
walls were coated in slimy fungi.  In the centre of the chamber was a
large device, like a large bullet, with tasteful Art Deco designs
worked into the exterior, held by metal girders over a pit of lava
glowing orange, yellow, purple, green, and blue.  The device was
tended to by some cultists wearing more work-practical robes, who were
using cigar-shaped devices which emitted blinding light.

A dozen thin-looking people wearing black head dresses carried buckets
of bubbling black liquid from a pool to the lava pit.  There were
three creatures, with greyish-green skin, white bellies, scaly backs;
humanoid but with the heads of fish with great bulging eyes, and
palpitating gills in the necks.  Two of these creatures held tridents
and were shepherding the thin people[^may19_1].  The third creature,
significantly larger, held globs of grey slime in its hands and was
waving them around as if directing traffic.  Across from the pool of
bubbling black liquid was a pool of clean-looking water.

[^may19_1]: Who you guessed to be human slaves.

Also in the room was a large statue of the bloated woman, much taller
than a person, facing the wall.  Hundreds of severed human arms hung
from its tentacles.  Its base was stained with blood.  Near the
entrance was a pile of boxes.  There were a few doorways, only one
with actual doors.

Wilhelmina and Jason saw that Carson was about to lose it at the sight
of all this, and Jason managed to clamp a hand over Carson's mouth
before he could draw attention.

Able to move fairly freely, due to the amount of people in the room
looking at the statue or the device, Jason and Arthur made their way
to the pile of crates and examined one of the devices used by the
worker-cultists.

Then the naval bombardment began, and the room erupted into panic and
chaos.  Many cultists started making their way to the exit.

Taking advantage of the chaos, you started planting sticks of dynamite
at the bases of the metal girders supporting the device above the lava
pit.  Clarissa was noticed by the large fish-person, but before it
could do anything Carson smacked it over the head with a crowbar.  The
pool of bubbling black slime exploded into the room.

A large glob of black slime, holding itself together in a rough
sphere, constantly undulating and forming appendages which last for a
second before being reabsorbed and reformed into something else,
emerged from the pool.  Everyone but you and the fish people had now
fled the room.  The fish people leapt into the pool of water and
disappeared.

Horrified by what had been unleashed, Carson let out a scream.

<aside class="highlight">
Carson gains myxophobia.
</aside>

The doors slammed open, and a man strode out.  Arthur recognised Roger
Penhew.  Penhew took stock of the situation, raised his arm, and
shouted a command.  The liquid creature was hurled against the wall.
Penhew looked totally absorbed in the strain of keeping the creature
under control.

Arthur tried to tear his gaze away from the creature, to continue the
mission.  But he panicked, dropped the dynamite without lighting it,
and ran through the doors Penhew came from, slamming them behind him.
Arthur found himself in a workroom with books, intricate mechanisms,
and papers written in an unknown alphabet scattered everywhere.  On
the wall as a chronometer of the same make as the one in the Ju-Ju
House, set to GMT.  When he calmed down enough to have a proper look
around, Arthur found Penhew's diaries, which he grabbed.

The dropped stick of dynamite had rolled next to the girder it was
supposed to destroy, so Jason shot at it, blowing it up.  The other
sticks of dynamite also started to explode.  The device started to
list over into the lava.

The explosions broke Penhew's concentration.  The creature surged
forward and engulfed him.

Arthur managed to muster the courage to leave the room, and ran around
the creature to join up with the others near the exit.  You all
started to run up the stairs, and heard the creature behind you start
to move.  Turning around you saw it had dropped Penhew's dead and
partially digested body, as it moved towards you.  You ran, as the
remaining dynamite exploded, and the device fell into the lava.

At the surface you dropped all your remaining dynamite, lit, and
clambered down the side of the volcano to the beach as it exploded
behind you.  Nothing pursued.

After a little while, the ship came to pick you back up.  You then
sailed around to the far side of the island to collect the other team.

While waiting for them, you looked through Penhew's diaries, which
talked about constructing the device, and made frequent mention to
Robert Huston in Australia.
