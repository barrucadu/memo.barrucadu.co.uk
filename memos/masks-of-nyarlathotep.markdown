Peru session 1, 2018-09-29
--------------------------

You all responded to a newspaper advert looking for participants in an
expedition to find an unknown pyramid in Peru, organised by one
Augustus Larkin.

In Lima, Peru, you met Augustus Larkin, a sickly looking white man
with a British accent, who you noticed is possibly suffering opioid
withdrawal symptoms; Luis de Mendoza, a Hispanic-looking man, who is
Larkin's silent and imposing assistant; and Jesse Hughes, an
African-American folklorist.  "Jesse Hughes" is actually an alias he
has given Larkin, his real identity is Jackson Elias, a not-unknown
author who investigates and writes about real-world cults.

Over dinner, Larkin gave you an overview of the expedition and what he
hopes to find.  Afterwards, Jackson Elias revealed that he has doubts:
he's in Peru to investigate an ancient death cult behind the legend of
the "kharisiri", fat-sucking vampires.  Mendoza has a fearsome
reputation, and Larkin is acting strangely; Jackson Elias thinks that
they, the pyramid, and this expedition are all connected to the cult
somehow.

You, and Jackson Elias, are staying in the Hotel Maury; Larkin and
Mendoza are staying in the Hotel Espana.  The expedition leaves the
morning of the day after tomorrow to Puno, and from there into the
mountains: so you have one evening and one full day in Lima.

The following morning you went with Jackson Elias to meet with
Professor Memesio Sanchez, a respected archaeologist and historian at
the local university. Professor Sanchez has offered numerous times to
help Larkin's expedition, but been rebuffed or ignored every time.  He
thinks that Larkin plans to steal the pyramid's historical treasures
and take them abroad, which the law currently does not prevent.  He
and his assistant, the undergraduate Trinidad Rizo, have been
conducting research into the possible location of the pyramid, based
on documents in the university archives.

Rizo was taking an unusually long time to arrive at the meeting, so
you---not including Jackson Elias and Professor Sanchez---went to the
store room to investigate.  There you found signs of a struggle, and
Rizo's dead body.  Boxes had been knocked off shelves, and she was
partly buried.  You found the skin stretched tightly over her bones,
as if the fat had been removed from her body, and a large circular
wound in her chest.

---

It is now around noon.

Dr. Crane, you were examining the body.

Lady Ashdown, you had found footprints leaving the room.

What are the rest of you doing?


Peru session 2, 2018-10-27
--------------------------

Still reeling from the shock of finding Rizo's damaged body,
Prof. Musgrave ran back to the office to fetch Prof. Sanchez and
Jackson Elias.

Dr. Crane, as he finished his examination of the body and climbed to
his feet noticed two things previously missed: a sheet of handwritten
paper sticking out of Rizo's jacket pocket, and the glint of gold from
a crate next to her body.  You all read the paper while you waited for
Prof. Musgrave and the rest to return: it was Rizo's notes on "The
Final Confessions of Gaspar Figueroa", a conquistador who came to Peru
in 1541.  The notes describe how he and his companions---Hernando
Ruiz, Diego Garrido, Luis de Mendoza, and Pedro de Velasco---found an
ancient temple near Lake Titicaca full of gold, how they removed some
of the gold and, that night, all turned into ravenous monsters who
pursued Figueroa.  Figueroa eventually arrived in Lima, wasted and
weakened by his ordeal, still carrying the gold they removed.  For the
rest of his days, Figueroa was plagued by hearing the voices of his
friends, crying out in inhuman hunger; and another voice, ancient and
seductive, promising him eternal life if he returned to the temple.

Musgrave, Sanchez, and Elias all arrived back.  Prof. Sanchez, shocked
and grieving, collapsed to the floor next to Rizo's corpse; Lady
Ashdown examined the gold in the crate, and found it to be a solid
gold band covered in geometric shapes, with ragged edges as if it had
been torn from a larger design, and managed to get enough sense out of
Prof. Sanchez to learn that this gold was found with the Gaspar
Figueroa documents.  The crate itself looked like it had been torn
apart, rather than being damaged by simply falling to the floor as a
shelf was knocked.  Furthermore, she noticed that the gold, while cold
to the touch, had burned scraps of skin stuck to it, as if someone had
tried to pick it up while red hot.

You all argued about how best to distribute weapons amongst the party
as you pursued the presumed attacker by following the bloody
footprints, until Sanchez cried out "we have to call the *police*!"
You decided to split up: Jackson Elias and Prof. Sanchez would go back
to his office to call the police, Wilhelmina would stay here to watch
the body, and the rest of you would follow the footprints.

The footprints became harder and harder to track, and you lost them
back in the corridor leading to Prof. Sanchez's office.  In front of
you was the door outside, to your left were the offices.  Lady Ashdown
and Jason Steele went outside, Dr. Crane and Prof. Musgrave decided to
go check out the offices.  As they arrived at Prof. Sanchez's office,
Prof. Musgrave glimpsed a face peering in through the window, which
quickly disappeared.  The window looked out onto an area behind the
university building full of trees and shrubbery, with no paths and few
visitors.  You both, and Jackson Elias, climbed out of the window, but
couldn't see anyone.  Prof. Musgrave heard quiet footsteps not very
far away, as of someone trying to sneak away, and ran towards the
source.

Prof. Musgrave emerged into a clearing, to find Luis de Mendoza, who
turned slowly and fixed the professor with a silent gaze.  Dr. Crane
and Jackson Elias caught up as you stared each other down.
Prof. Musgrave drew a gun, and tried to question Mendoza: silence.
Jackson Elias tried in Spanish: silence.  Dr. Crane went to fetch the
others; after he left, Mendoza charged Prof. Musgrave, who shot him
twice without slowing him down.  Mendoza barreled into the professor,
tackling him to the ground, but got shot at point-blank range by
Jackson Elias, flinging him off, and he lay still.  Everyone but
Wilhelmina, who was still watching the body, showed up a few minutes
later.  Dr. Crane examined the body and said that no man could survive
that.  About half an hour later, the police showed up and took over.

You decided to go confront Larkin, to see what he knew about Mendoza
and, if nothing else, to tell him he needed a new bodyguard as you'd
killed his current one.  You arrived at the Hotel Espana and met the
aged proprietor, Petronila Cupitina, who directed you to Larkin and
Mendoza's rooms.  Both were silent.  After fiddling around with
lockpicks and considering scaling the exterior of the building, you
discovered Larkin's room was actually unlocked all along, and
cautiously entered.  The room was a tip, with things scattered
everywhere.  There you found Larkin, out of his mind on a large dose
of heroin, which Dr. Crane estimated would not be fatal, but which
would last several more hours.  Larkin vaguely recognised you, but was
unable to do anything more than suggest that you meet some other time.

You decided to snoop around and look for clues.  Wilhelmina
unsuccessfully tried to find a map to the pyramid.  Jackson Elias
noticed that Larkin had a large tattoo on his check: of a person, but
in the place of his head was a large spiral.  He recognised this as
the symbol of the Cult of the Bloody Tongue, a particularly violent
Kenyan cult, and had no idea what would bring them to Peru.  Under the
stench of Larkin's strong cologne, Lady Ashdown noticed the faint
smell of rotting meat.

You then broke into Mendoza's room.  In contrast to Larkin's, it was
spotlessly clean, as if it had never been used.  Again, Wilhelmina
unsuccessfully looked for a map.  Jason Steele found a small mirror of
polished gold beneath the mattress, the only personal item in the
room.  Prof. Musgrave examined it... and had a brief vision of white
tentacles bursting through a pyramid.

You decided to come back after a few hours to talk to Larkin when he
was sober again.  Prof. Musgrave went back to his hotel room to rest.
The rest of you confronted Larkin, telling him that Mendoza had killed
a girl at the university, and asking how long Mendoza had been in his
employ.  Larkin expressed shock and disbelief that Mendoza would do
such a thing, and said that he had only known Mendoza for a few
months.  Lady Ashdown realised that Larkin was lying.  Larkin seemed
to have no recollection of your visit that afternoon.

The following morning, you set off to Puno in the Andean foothills.
Larkin was determined that the loss of Mendoza not slow down the
expedition.  This was an uneventful three-day journey by truck, during
which you fought off altitude sickness.

You had one night to rest in Puno before heading out the next morning
to the pyramid on foot.  Most of you chose to stay in the hotel, but
Wilhelmina decided to roam the streets.  She realised an old woman was
following her, and confronted this person.  The old woman asked if
Wilhelmina was with Larkin and, upon hearing that she was but that she
didn't trust Larkin, the woman said to follow her.  She said her name
was Nayra, and that she didn't think it was a good idea to go with
Larkin to the pyramid.  She told a local legend, of an unknown dark
god that fell from the sky into Lake Titicaca, and brought hunger and
famine with it.  One day a hero lured the god into a cave, which was
full of the most delicious tubers and grubs; and sealed the cave with
huge rocks.  A pyramid was then built over the cave, with spells
worked in gold to keep the god imprisoned forever.  Wilhelmina
wondered aloud if the god had escaped[^peru2_1], at which Nayra
crossed herself[^peru2_2] and shuddered.

[^peru2_1]: Out-of-character at this point you were discussing a few
  theories: such as if the golden band at at the university which
  Gaspar Figueroa brought from a pyramid was part of the golden seal
  used to keep the god imprisoned, and if Mendoza was some aspect or
  manifestation of this god who had escaped when the seal was broken.

[^peru2_2]: Nayra seems to follow a mixture of Catholicism and local
  beliefs.

The following morning, you discussed what you knew, and sent a
telegram off to Prof. Sanchez detailing your findings.  You thought
that you might need to bring the gold band to the pyramid, so it's
best for him to be prepared.

You then set out into the jungle with Larkin, using pack animals to
carry your supplies.  No locals would accompany you now.  After a few
hours you stopped for lunch, and Lady Ashdown spied a majestic jaguar
in the distance.

That night around 3am, the noise of one of the pack animals in
distress alerted Dr. Crane, who was on watch, and awakened Lady
Ashdown, a light sleeper.  You found a filthy man, stinking and
dressed in rags, pinning one of the animals to the ground with his
face pressed into it.  Lady Ashdown hit the man in the head with a
crowbar, knocking him off the animal, and revealing that his mouth was
no human mouth: it was circular and full of sharp teeth, much like a
lamprey.  The rest of you had awoken at this point, and easily dealt
with the man.

---

It is now around 3am.

You're all standing around the body of a lamprey-man who was feeding
on one of your pack animals, whose head has been smashed in with a
crowbar.

What do you do?
