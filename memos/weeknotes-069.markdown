## Work

This week I've been doing a lot of machine learning stuff with Amazon
SageMaker.  We're trying to host the training and deployment of our ML
model for ranking search results.  It's been fiddly, but I think I'm
almost there: I'll write up a more detailed blog post when it's done.

## Miscellaneous

I've been reading about the [Zettelkasten][] method for keeping notes.
It sounds interesting, and I'd like to give it a try.  But first I
need to get some index cards.  I could do it digitally, but I've tried
many digital note-taking systems (including these memos), but nothing
has really stuck.  Maybe an analogue system will work better for me.

Here are some more articles about Zettelkasten and note-taking:

I decided to level up my kitchen abilities, so I bought a few
cookbooks:

- The Science of Spice: Understand flavour connections and revolutionize your cooking
- my bread: The revolutionary no-work, no-knead method
- Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat: Mastering the Elements of Good Cooking
- The Noma Guide to Fermentation
- The Flavour Thesaurus: Pairings, recipes and ideas for the creative cook

I've been reading the bread book and Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat.  I made
some bread, which went pretty well, but I can see some ways to improve
it.  I also made some mayonnaise, which was much harder than expected
(getting egg yolk to combine with oil is tricky), but worked pretty
well.  There's a lot more I want to try, but my first goal is seeing
if I can make good enough bread to not need to buy it any more.  For
that I need to make it more bread-shaped, rather that "squashed
football" shape, so I can use it for sandwiches.
