## Work

Again, not very much to report this week.  Hopefully more soon.


## Books

This week I read:

- [Scenic Dunnsmouth][] by Zzarchov Kowolski, an adventure module for
  [Lamentations of the Flame Princess][], though I think it should
  work for most RPG systems without too much modification.  It's a
  book about how to randomly generate the scenic swamp-village of
  Dunnsmouth, and the various horrors that may lurk within it.  As the
  village is randomly generated (even taking the relative positions of
  the dice you roll into account), two instances are very unlikely to
  be the same, so it should have good replayability (perhaps with a
  bit of reflavouring of magic and renaming of NPCs each time).

- [Kobold Guide to Gamemastering][] by Sean K. Reynolds *et al.*, a
  collection of essays on running games.  I didn't find this one as
  useful as their guide to worldbuilding, but there are still some
  good tips in it.  I've also got their guide to plots and campaigns
  to have a look at.

I've also been reading the third [Malazan][] book.  I've now got over
a hundred unread books in my London flat, so I'm going to cut down on
buying new books for a little while.

## Games

Pulp Cthulhu is going strong, though my players haven't quite got the
hang of how much more luck they can get away with spending now.  We're
mostly through the Peru chapter and, I think, likely to wrap it up
next session.
