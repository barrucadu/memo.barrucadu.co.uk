> There was once a young Discordian called Golden Rod. Early in his
> illumination, he wondered what season his country was in.
>
> Perhaps it was in the season of Discord, on the cusp of
> Bureaucracy. Surely, Order was rising to noxious levels.
>
> Or perhaps it was already Bureaucracy, on the cusp of
> Aftermath. Surely, Disorder was rising to obnoxious levels.
>
> So in his quest for An Answer, Golden Rod sought out the Discordian
> monk Nopants. Nopants dwelled in a basement because it would be
> obscene for him to go outside. Golden Rod freed himself from his
> leggings and descended the stairs. Below, Nopants sat on a cushion
> in a gross lotus position.
>
> "My wise friend Nopants, I have come to ask you a question," said
> Golden Rod, "What is Bureaucracy?"
>
> "In India," said Nopants, "they tie elephants to trees using thin
> cords. An elephant could easily snap the cord, yet they remain
> tethered in place. Why do you think this is?"
>
> Golden Rod itched himself and shrugged.
>
> "When the elephant is young," intoned Nopants, "she is too weak to
> break the cord. She tries, but eventually she gives up. When the
> elephant grows up, she does not try to escape her puny bonds because
> she believes she will fail."
>
> "So the cord isn't the thing keeping the elephant in place," said
> Golden Rod. He squinted at Nopants, "That's very interesting, but what
> does that have to do with Bureaucracy?"
>
> "Bureaucracy," said Nopants, "is waiting for a red traffic light in
> the middle of the night when no one is coming."
>
> Across space and time, a gong sounded.
>

>
> Golden Rod left the basement and returned to the real world,
> thoroughly confused. As he drove home, he ran five red lights. His
> mirth rose with each light. By the end of the voyage he was giggling
> like a ninny at his newfound freedom.
>
> Years went by and Golden Rod continued drive towards Aftermath. He
> ignored stop signs, blew through red lights, and opened his moon roof
> despite danger of falling rocks.
>
> "Sweet Merciful Ass!" cried out Bung-Fu the Fool as he clawed at the
> dashboard. "You're gonna get us both killed!"
>
> "Nonsense! I am self-emancipated from these mundane traffic laws,"
> cackled Golden Rod. "I am a harbinger of Aftermath!"
>
> "Do you always drive like this?" said Bung-Fu as he buckled his seat
> belt.
>
> Golden Rod nodded. "Always."
>
> Meanwhile, the monk Nopants was wheeling his gong across the street
> towards his basement. He patiently waited for the light to turn red,
> then pushed the ponderous percussive instrument upon the pavement.
>
> The collision made the exact sound of enlightenment.
