## Work

A short week, god save the queen and all that.

I was a "first responder" again this week, and solved a few problems
I'd not in my previous shift, so it's good to learn new things.  The
team are planning to have me do one more week of pairing before I'm
added to the rota proper.

## Books

This week I read:

- [A Fire Upon the Deep][] by Vernor Vinge

  Yet another [SF Masterworks][] book, this one set in our universe,
  but where the galaxy is divided into "zones of thought": the
  Unthinking Depths close to the core where even human-level
  intelligence is impossible; the Slow Zone, which contains the Earth,
  and where biological sentience is common but true AI is impossible;
  the Beyond, which has true AI, fantastic technology, and FTL travel
  (because achieving all those things requires a level of intelligence
  not sustainable in the lower levels); and finally the Transcend,
  which is beyond what we can imagine and whose inhabitants are like
  gods.

  The book kicks off with a human civilisation of the high Beyond
  accidentally awakening a dormant power, referred to as "the Blight",
  in the low Transcend, ultimately dooming themselves and many other
  civilisations.  It then switches between the story of a small group
  of humans who escaped the catastrophe and crash-landed on a world in
  the low Beyond inhabited by dog-like creatures with group minds who
  have been stuck for thousands of years in a medieval-style
  civilisation, and the story of another ship from the high Beyond
  desperately trying to reach this world to recover something capable
  of striking down the Blight which stowed away with the escapees.

  As these old SF classics go, this is a fairly long one, at nearly
  600 pages.  Most of them seem to top out at 2--300.  Despite that, I
  got through it in only a few days: it's a real page-turner, and the
  alternating stories really contributed to that, as I'd read a bit,
  think "ok, I should go to bed when I finish this chapter"... and
  then the next chapter would pick off at whatever cliffhanger the
  other story paused at---how could I stop then?
