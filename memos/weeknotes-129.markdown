## Work

I took this week off work, and spent it watching things, reading
things, and playing games.

## Books

This week I read:

- [Count Zero][] by William Gibson, the second of the [Sprawl trilogy][].

  This one was a bit confusing to follow, there are three separate
  storylines, they're pretty fast-paced, and they take a while to come
  together.  Malazan is *all* that style of writing, and I got through
  that fine, so I'm not too sure what my difficulty with Count Zero
  was.  Maybe it's because Count Zero is a single, fairly short, book;
  so when I was getting up to half or two-thirds of the way through
  and was still guessing how everything fit together, it felt like I
  was missing something, whereas with Malazan you go into it not
  expecting to be able to fit things together until you're multiple
  books further into the story.

  Putting aside the confusion, it was still an enjoyable read.

- Volume 4 of [Black Wings of Cthulhu][] edited by S. T. Joshi, an
  anthology of modern Lovecraftian stories.

  I particularly liked:

  - *The Rasping Absence* by Richard Gavin

    In which the horrors of dark matter drive a journalist to madness.
    A good classic "the universe is vast, and that's nightmarish"
    Lovecraft trope.

  - *Contact* by John Pelan and Stephen Mark Rainey

    Humanity travels the solar system frozen asleep for months at a
    time in big spacecraft, and one such craft is now approaching
    Pluto to investigate some rare mineral which has been detected.
    The previous ship never returned.  This one does, but they bring
    back an undesired guest.

  - *Dark Redeemer* by Will Murray

    About a secret US government agency who use [remote viewing][] to
    probe the secrets of reality.  Very X-Files or Delta Green.

  - *The Wall of Asshur-sin* by Donald Tyson

    I think this was my favourite in the collection.  A cyclopean
    archaeological artefact is discovered: a wall, holding the sea off
    from the Yemen desert.  People devote decades to studying it, but
    it has a secret purpose, known only to those descendants of the
    people who worshipped the original wall builders.

- Issue 1 of [The Peridot][] by David McGrogan.

  Described as "an irregularly published 'zine", but issue 1 came out
  in 2016 and there's no issue 2 yet, so I suspect that this is it.

  I found it of mixed utility.

  There's a Sumerian setting at the start which got me thinking about
  things.  I quite like bronze age RPG settings, because they're so
  different from your typical high fantasy faux-medieval-Europe
  setting, which is a nice change.  You don't get many
  [animals-with-the-faces-of-people][] in your standard fantasy, for
  some reason.  So it was nice to read a small setting for that style
  of play.  There was also the first (and likely only) instalment of a
  story written in the [Yoon-Suin][] setting, which I quite liked.
  The other bits of the zine, not so much.

- [Troika!][] by Daniel Sell.

  Troika's a science-fantasy RPG, where the implied setting is more of
  a super-far-future blend of sci-fi and magic like *The Book of the
  New Sun* and *Dying Earth* than it is *Lord of the Rings*.

  I ran a game this weekend, and I've posted my first impressions on
  [the other blog][].

  Just on the topic of the book, it's physically really nice.  Good
  thick paper, light coloured backgrounds with tables having a plain
  white background (so they really stand out), art in a weird but
  fitting style, and it's a hardback despite being short.  It just
  looks and feels very nice.

- [The Gardens of Ynn][] by Emmy Allen.

  A collection of random tables, interesting locations, and weird
  monsters---all garden-themed---for you to randomly generate a
  pointcrawl adventure.  I used it in my Troika session, and it worked
  pretty well!  There are parts where the layout isn't so great, or
  there are uncaught typos, but it's a fun and entirely usable
  product.

- [Hamlet's Hit Points][] by Robin D. Laws.

  It's very good, it defines a few different types of story beat and
  then goes through Hamlet, Dr. No, and Casablanca breaking them down
  into beats and showing how the narratives use fear & hope to keep
  the audience engaged.  And looking back on some of my recent
  sessions, I can see where I've done that sort of thing, though
  without consciously thinking of it in those terms.

  The basic premise is that most story beats should be *procedural*,
  bringing the party's concrete goals into play, or *dramatic*,
  bringing the party's inner goals into play.  And that beats should
  generally inspire positive or negative emotions, rather than being
  mixed or neutral.  There are a bunch of other minor beat types to
  use sparingly too, such as the *bringdown*, which is a negative
  emotional moment disconnected from the main plot (like the trope of
  the rejected lover walking home in the rain and then getting
  splashed by a passing car).  I'll need to think about this some
  more, and hopefully bring some of the ideas into how I prepare game
  sessions.

## Gaming

I ran a session of [Troika!][] today, and it was very fun.  It's easy
to pick up, as the rules aren't complex; and it's full of
opportunities to inject humour and silliness, because the setting is
so weird.

I wrote about it on [the other blog][].


## Miscellaneous

I watched [The Haunting of Hill House][] and [Truth Seekers][] this
week.  Both were enjoyable, in their own ways.  I'm not much of a fan
of jump scares, and unfortunately Hill House had quite a lot of those.
I also watched the extended Lord of the Rings films in a single, very
long, sitting.

Some exciting news is that [a District 9 sequel is finally in the
works][].
