## Work

This has been a week of preparation: the switch over to Digital
Identity is happening soon.  We've been putting together pull requests
for downtime---in which we'll do the user migration---and for the new
configuration.


## Books

This week I read:

- [World War Z][] by Max Brooks

  The book is not much like the film.  Or, rather, the film is not
  much like the book, since the book came first.  I think the book was
  better: the film picks a couple of the stories from the book and
  expands on them, presenting them in real-time through the eyes of
  the narrator who travels around; whereas the book comes a decade
  *after* the zombie war, and is the accounts of survivors.  Also, the
  film ends with a cure being found, so in the film the whole zombie
  plague lasts for... a couple of months, at most.  Which isn't very
  exciting really.

  I found the idea of <span class="spoiler">the virus spreading
  quickly via black-market organ transplants</span> delightfully
  creepy, I don't think I'd seen that done before.

## Gaming

This week I've been thinking about rumour tables, which are a way of
giving information about what's going on in the world to the players
organically.  The GM comes up with a numbered list of rumours and,
when the characters are out carousing or gathering information or
whatever, the GM rolls on this list and presents what the players
find.  The players then might follow that lead, going straight for it
or perhaps looking for more information about that specific topic
first.

Simple enough.

The challenge, I've found, is coming up with a *good* list of rumours.
I wanted 20 for my Traveller sandbox campaign, and I've settled on:

- No rumour, a random encounter happens!
- A few "rumour templates": calls to generate something there and then
  from tables in the Traveller rulebooks.
- A few new rumours about things they're already interested in.
- But mostly new rumours I've prepared to give the players some lore
  and hooks pointing to things they don't yet know about.

I'll see how it goes over the next few sessions.  Maybe rumour tables
will be the next topic on [the RPG blog][].
