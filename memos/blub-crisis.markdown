I have realised in recent conversations about programming languages, and in reflection of my very
negative and kind of arrogant [blog post about Go][goblog], that I have become trapped by the Blub
Paradox.  I have become dismissive of non-Haskell languages.  I think in Haskell.  Languages less
powerful than Haskell are obviously too limited to get any real work done in, and languages with
more advanced features than Haskell (like dependent types) are really just weird and not actually
solving a problem I would ever face.

The arrogance!  Such a know-it-all!

I have decided to call such a realisation a "Blub Crisis".  Haskell is my Blub.  The only solution
is to become proficient---actually proficient---in a different language, and once again learn a new
way of thinking.
