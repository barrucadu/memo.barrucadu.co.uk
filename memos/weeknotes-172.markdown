## Work

Three days of work this week, in which I got almost nothing done.  I
should have just taken them off as well.


## Books

No books this week.


## Miscellaneous

It's a new year.  Last week I visited family, this week I've been back
in my flat, mostly relaxing.

I bought some more teas.  This is the first time since September, as
I've been working through some of the ones I *like*, but not *as much
as* others, and which had lingered in the cupboard for several months.
Those are mostly gone now, and the particularly good teas have been
gone much longer, so I definitely needed to resupply.  I picked up
250g each of [China Yunnan Golden Tippy Black Tea][], [Nepal Golden
Snail Black Tea][], [Taiwan "Charcoal Roasted" Oolong Tea][], [Malawi
Leafy Ripe Dark Tea][], and [India Darjeeling 2nd Flush "Japonica
Muscatel" Black Tea][].  I've not had that particular darjeeling
before, but I'm not much of a darjeeling connoisseur: it's all good.

I also bought a new phone, at long last, which will be arriving in a
few weeks time.  I went for the new Google Pixel 6, because I saw an
advert for it.  I don't really care about my phone enough to do any
actual research into options, I just need something before my current
one inevitably explodes (it's been slowly swelling, pushing the screen
off, for about two years now, and lately the battery has been
struggling to hold a charge).  This will be my second smartphone ever,
so I guess I'll have to learn how to transfer contacts and suchlike
between Android devices.

The end of the year is a bit of a failure point for my [self
organisation system][], as my weekly, monthly, quarterly, and annual
chores all become due at once.  Thankfully the end of the year also
tends to be pretty quiet, so there's time to work through everything.
It's not *really* the new year until I [rotate my journal files][].

I have a few things on my list to get done over the coming weeks,
which I'm sure I'll talk about in one of these posts but, for this
week at least, I've been taking it easy.
