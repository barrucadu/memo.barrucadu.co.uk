## Ph.D

- Graduation was this week, so I've finally got the fancy paper which
  says I have a Ph.D.

## Miscellaneous

- I re-read [The Lathe of Heaven][] (by Ursula K. Le Guin), about a
  man forced to see a psychiatrist for his drug abuse, and heâ€™s
  abusing drugs because he believes that his dreams change reality.

- I read for the first time [We Have Always Lived in the Castle][] (by
  Shirley Jackson), about a family living in a mansion on the
  outskirts of a village who are shunned by the villagers for their
  dark past, which is gradually revealed over the story.  It was good,
  it's not the first Shirley Jackson story I've read, I've also got a
  collection of short stories.

- I unintentionally started to re-read [Magician][] (by Raymond
  E. Feist).  I bought it on Friday, and discovered that I already had
  a copy [in bookdb][]: it's listed as being in Hull, which means I
  last saw it in 2010.  I think this is the first time I've totally
  forgotten about owning a book and bought a second copy.  As I've
  been reading it, the story has been coming back to me, but it's
  still enjoyable.

- I bought some other new books which I haven't started on yet, [Metro
  2033][] (by Dmitry Glukhovsky), and the [Neuromancer][] trilogy (by
  William Gibson).
