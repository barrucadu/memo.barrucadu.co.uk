Player characters
-----------------

- **Rachel Summers:** librarian (scholar).  A recent high school
  graduate, who was inspired to a love of books by her school's
  librarian.  Rachel is a bit of a bookworm, particularly focussing on
  nonfiction, with a good working knowledge of Latin and biology.

  *1921 update:* Rachel has suppressed the memory of freeing Gla'aki
  and causing the destruction of Scotland, and is a bit unstable
  because of it.

  *Known spells:*
  - Contact Deity Nyarlathotep
  - Contact Deity Tsathoggua
  - Contact Yithian
  - Create Mist of R'lyeh
  - Elder Sign
  - Shrivelling

- **Cassie Black:** <span class="highlight">[indefinitely insane]</span>
  private investigator (femme fatale).  An ex-policewoman who left the
  force to become a private investigator.  Cassie is a long-time
  friend of Jackson's; as students they once stole a flamingo from the
  zoo.

- **Kintsugi Ikehara:** laborer (outsider).  A mixed-race
  Japanese/Peruvian daughter of an immigrant eking out a living with
  her mother, her only relative.  Kints wants an out from her poor
  life.

  *1925 update:* Kints has been living in the US with Dill and his
  wife for some years, and now speaks fluent English.  She's kept in
  touch with Penelope and Rachel, and met Cassie when they responded
  to Jackson's summons.

  *Known spells:*
  - Contact Deity Nodens

### Retired

- **Alton "Dill" Dillinger:** Assistant Secretary for Fish, Wildlife
  and Parks - U.S. Department of the Interior.  Formerly a senator for
  the state of Pennsylvania, he fell from public favour by opposing
  U.S. entry into the First World War.  He did not win re-election.
  Perhaps out of pity, perhaps just trying to get him out of the way,
  political friends of his arranged for him to have a rather
  unimportant and out-of-the-way position.

- **Penelope Temple:** librarian / parapsychologist (cult leader).  A
  co-worker of Rachel's, though she didn't always work in the library.
  Penelope and her now-deceased husband were once burglars, until one
  fateful job which ended in the foiled robbery of a secret society's
  headquarters and the death (or, at least, disappearance) of her
  husband Percival.

  *1921 update:* Penelope has risen through the ranks of the Silver
  Twilight Lodge and caused a schism, leaving her librarian job to
  head a new cult centred around Gla'aki.

MoN Lore
--------

### Cosmology

*This is a combination of Malazan magic and Cthulhu cosmology.*

There is a physical world of houses and cars, planets and stars.
Inhabited by animals, humans, aliens, and all living things.  You are
here.

Coterminous with the physical world, and yet separate to it, are a
multitude of other realms, called warrens.  Spirit worlds, you could
say.  Other dimensions.  Other planes.  These are the realms which
magic comes from and which gods inhabit.

Some warrens represent primal, elemental, forces.  These were formed
out of the primal chaos of the early multiverse, and are called Elder
Warrens.

The Necronomicon speaks of:

- **Denaeth Rusen:** water (or non-solid matter in general)
- **Kaschan:** gravity
- **Kurald Galain:** darkness
- **Kurald Thyrllan:** light
- **Kurald Emurlahn:** shadow
- **Omtose Phellack:** ice (or the absence of heat in general)
- **Starvald Demelain:** life
- **Telann:** fire (or heat in general)

Each Elder Warren is ruled by an Elder God, a being with absolute
power over what its warren governs.

Only some of the Elder Gods are known:

- **Denaeth Rusen:** Nodens, the Lord of the Great Abyss
- **Kurald Galain:** Nyarlathotep, the God of a Thousand Forms
- **Starvald Demelain:** Shub-Niggurath, the Black Goat of the Woods with a Thousand Young
- **Telann:** Cthugha, the Living Conflagration

Some warrens are younger, hewn out of the Elder Warrens by great
sorcerors and their rituals.  They are the most common way for magic
to be accessed by mortal beings.  These are called Paths.

The Necronomicon speaks of:

- **Meanas:** illusion
- **Mockra:** mind
- **Ruse:** the sea
- **Serc:** the sky
- **Tennes:** the land
- **Verdith'anan:** death

The King in Yellow, also called Hastur, once a mortal (though not
human) sorceror, holds the thrones of both Meanas and Mockra.

In addition there are Paths representing the same power as an Elder
Warren, but not directly a part of the same other-world:

- **Rashan:** darkness
- **Telas:** fire
- **Thyr:** light

A warren is simultaneously another world---which can be travelled to
and journeyed through---and power over some aspect of the physical
world.  For example, Withering is an application of Verdith'anan, the
Path of Death.  The warrens move around relative to the physical world
and to each other, such that if a sorceror opens a gateway into a
warren, steps through, waits, and steps back out, they may end up in a
different place to where they started.  Magic is used by opening a
gateway to a warren and drawing some of its power through.

It is rumoured that a warren can be "unveiled", a permanent
manifestation such that some region of the physical world becomes just
as much a part of the warren.

Each Path is connected to the Elder Warren it splintered from.  In
turn, each Elder Warren is connected to Chaos, the primal force of the
early universe, the source of all things, ruled over by the Elder God
Azathoth.  Mercifully, Azathoth is an idiot god in truth, and does not
often exercise His power over all existence.

But Azathoth is not quite the end.

Beyond Azathoth, beyond Chaos, is Yog-Sothoth, the All-in-One and
One-in-All, the Gate and the Key, the god who reaches across not just
space and time, who steps between not just every warren in our
multiverse, but even between the multiverses themselves.  Pray there
is nothing beyond even Yog-Sothoth.

#### So what?

Kurald Galain has difficulty manifesting where the influence of Kurald
Thyrllan is present, without large rituals.  Magic and creatures can
slip through, but a god is much more a part of their warren than is a
creature which lives there.  So Nyarlathotep cannot step from Kurald
Galain into the physical world, where Kurald Thyrllan is active.

This is why Nyarlathotep has to work through visions, dreams, and
manifestations in sanctified places (like the Bent Pyramid).

### Character motivations

#### Gods

- **Nyarlathotep:** to create a permanent unveiling of Kurald Galain,
  giving a gateway between his elder warren and the physical world.

- **Nodens:** the desire to mess up Nyarlathotep's plans, consequences
  be damned.

#### Major cult leaders

These three leaders are utterly devoted to the aspect of Nyarlathotep
they worship; believe they will be one of the chosen rulers of the
Earth after most of humanity perish; and desire power.  They are
sociopaths, only seeing other people as tools.

- **M'Weru**
- **Omar Al'Shakti**
- **Ho Fang**

#### Expedition principals

- **Roger Carlyle:** an insane devotion to M'Weru and the belief that
  he will become part of something greater than himself.

- **Jack Brady:** loyalty to Roger.

- **Robert Huston:** initially, fear that Roger would expose that he
  made his lover secretly abort their child before word of the
  pregnancy got out; later, power and a desire to get one over on all
  those who made fun of the "fashionable, Freudian, psychoanalyst".

- **Hypatia Masters:** love of Roger.

- **Aubrey Penhew:** power, immortality, and the return of his youth;
  like the cult leaders he is a sociopath who sees others only as
  tools ever since discovering the Black Pharaoh and his promises in
  Egypt decades ago.

#### Minor cult leaders

- **Mukunga M'Dari:** fear of M'Weru.

- **Silas N'Kwane:** loyalty to M'Weru.

- **Edward Gavigan:** loyalty to Aubrey, and the desire to wrest
  control of the main cult from Omar.

- **Zahra Shafik:** loyalty to Omar, and the desire to wrest control
  of the branch cult from Edward.

First-class travel on an ocean liner, or working your way on a
freighter, lets you learn a new skill or improve an existing one, in
addition to the usual hero development phase[^learn].

[^learn]: Make a **POW** roll.  On a success, when improving a skill,
  gain `+1d6`, when learning a new skill set to `1d10+5`.  Any skill
  may be chosen so long as there is a plausible explanation for how
  you could learn it (eg, fencing lessons on an ocean liner, or mech
  repair from engine maintenance on a steamer).

Ports:

- **USA:** New York
- **England:** Southampton
- **Egypt:** Port Said
- **Kenya:** Mombasa
- **Australia:** Melbourne

### Peru lore

Kharisiri have Strigoi-like (*i.e.* from The Strain) flesh-tentacles
to drain fat.  They only use their mouth to "kiss" and transfer a
larva.


Gla'aki Arc Lore
----------------

### Notable NPCs

- **William and Robert Brophy:** Servants of Gla'aki, on the loose
  somewhere in New England with an Avatar of Gla'aki.

- **Howard Carter:** contact from Penelope's criminal days, who poses
  as an author.  Was investigating the spines for Penelope, later
  found dead.  Seems he knows more about this sort of thing than
  Penelope initially suspected.

- **Dr. Clayton Armitage:** contact of Howard's, he knows something
  about the spines and their power.  Leads the "UK branch" of the
  Silver Twilight Lodge, though it's just a country house with a
  handful of other members.

- **Carl Stanford:** leader of the Silver Twilight Lodge.  "Carl" and
  "the Lodge" were mentioned in Howard and Dr. Armitage's telegrams.

### Gla'aki and its cult

Gla'aki is [Loch Morar][], which was created by the impact of the
crystal prison.  The cult is widespread throughout Scotland, extending
as far south as the Yorkshire Dales.

The cult consists solely of undead Servants of Gla'aki, which are
little more than mind-controlled puppets.

The cult has difficulty spreading around the world because Gla'aki
cannot leave the loch, and its fluid and spines drastically lose
potency as soon as they are removed from its body, so creating new
Servants elsewhere is difficult.  Gla'aki can create Avatars even from
this weak fluid, but it takes years for an Avatar to become capable of
creating Servants.

There is an Avatar in [Derwentwater][] in the Lake District and in
[Lough Leane][] in Ireland.  The spines that the gang retrieved from
the Squatter's Lake Motel are inferior spines from a still-growing
Avatar.

Furthermore, in the centuries during which Gla'aki slumbers, it cannot
create new Servants, so the cult inevitably shrinks as Servants pass
away due to accidents.  All of the current Avatars and Servants were
created during Gla'aki's current period of wakefulness, which has
lasted for 90 years.

There are two remaining shards of the crystal prison.  If these are
taken to Gla'aki (or an Avatar) he can free himself.  They're in
[Pingualuit crater][] in Quebec and in a university in Costa Rica.

### The Silver Twilight Lodge

Founded and lead by Carl Stanford, the STL is a fraternal organisation
based in Boston, Massachusettes, which purports to investigate the
occult and unexplained.  It's not a secret society, though it is a
"society with secrets" and is relatively small and unknown.

Members vary in how much they *know* and how much they *believe*.
Most members have at least some belief in the reality of the occult,
though they know very little.  Carl Stanford and those close to him
more than just believe: they know this stuff to be the truth, and they
have a great deal of knowledge.  Any artefacts and tomes which the STL
gains possession of are only available for extended study by this core
group.

While the STL appears to be a purely investigative organisation, Carl
Stanford and a few of his closest associates are using it to further
the aims of alien gods.

Dr. Armitage is the leader of the UK branch of the Lodge.  He
considers himself a good friend of Carl Stanford, though Carl is
concealing the true purpose of the Lodge from him.  Carl has long ago
realised that having honest people in positions of authority is very
good for maintaining cover, as then if any rumours leak out, they
react with genuine bafflement.

### Questions: Dr. Armitage and Howard Carter

- **Why was Howard killed by a Servant by Dr. Armitage, who has more
  potent spines and has been examining them for longer, has not
  been?**

  Dr. Armitage's country house, where he does his experiments, is
  warded (a simple Elder Sign on every entrance and a more complex one
  in the lab).  This means Gla'aki cannot mentally communicate with
  reanimated creatures inside the house.  It also means Servants
  cannot easily enter, as Gla'aki has destroyed their minds and
  controls them like puppets.

- **Why did Dr. Armitage tell Howard things that would get him killed,
  without also telling him about the wards?**

  Dr. Armitage doesn't know that Gla'aki can track down reanimated
  creatures: he's only ever done it inside his warded house.  The
  Revelations of Gla'aki merely state that "once one has been turned
  to the Great Master, they serve as His eyes and ears", which can
  easily be taken in a metaphorical sense, and that Servants just
  report back.

- **Why did Dr. Armitage send Howard volume 1 of the Revelations of
  Gla'aki?**

  Dr. Armitage knew Howard wouldn't have access to similar texts in
  the US branch of the STL due to his low status.

### Questions: Dealing with Gla'aki

- **How can they seal away Gla'aki?**

  Surround him with Elder Signs so he can't control his Servants
  (they'll become wild and animalistic without his will directing
  them).

  Or, surround him with a single Eye of Light and Darkness.

- **How can the Elder Sign solution be signalled?**

  Have Penelope's Gla'aki sense get cut off by Elder Signs.

- **Why didn't Penelope notice this when she visited Danvers or the UK
  STL before?**

  The sense is only gone in the immediate area around the Elder Sign.
  A mile away it begins to fade and half a mile away it is completely
  gone.  The sense is in the background, so she doesn't notice it
  fading if her mind is on other things.  This is not a great answer,
  because I didn't think of it before getting Elder Signs involved;
  we'll just have to accept this small retcon.

- **How many Elder Signs would it take to surround Loch Morar?**

  25.

- **That's 250 POW to cut off Gla'aki!  How can they get that much?**

  Unknown!  Figure this out later!

- **How can they get the Eye of Light and Darkness ritual?**

  They can't.  They have to leave the Gla'aki problem unsolved and
  come back to it after learning the ritual during Masks of
  Nyarlathotep.

- **How can they free Gla'aki?**

  Deliver crystals to him (or an Avatar), or seal the crystals away
  behind Elder Signs.


Gla'aki session 1, 2020-05-03
-----------------------------

We played *Servants of the Lake* (in *Doors to Darkness*) as a
one-shot.  Then the players wanted to continue the investigation, so I
had to turn this into a campaign.

I didn't take any notes in the session, but the gist of it is that
they found some zombies, ran away, and returned the next day to find
the motel burned down, everyone and everything gone, and a large trail
leading from the lake (as if something the size of a boat had been
dragged out and into the forest).

The only hard evidence they found were some large metal spines.


Gla'aki session 2, 2020-05-17
-----------------------------

### Prep

Penelope sent some of the weird metal spines you found to a discrete
acquaintance, Howard Carter, to have them examined.  Howard sent
frequent, excited, letters: the spines are biological, but don't
correspond to any earthly biology he knows of; when submerged in water
they slowly convert it into a cloudy yellowish fluid; and this fluid,
when injected into lab rats, kills them promptly but, after they are
definitely dead, they undergo violent muscle spasms, sometimes even
jumping and running for minutes.

Then the letters stopped.

Two weeks later, Penelope saw an obituary in the newspaper:

**Handout: Obituary**

> Mr. Howard Carter---of Providence, Rhode Island---was discovered
> dead in his home by the local mailman.  Mr Carter was an author
> known for his fantastical short stories sold to the literary
> magazines.  The coroner has ruled this as a death by natural causes.
> Mr. Carter has no known living relatives so, in accordance with
> state law, if no heir comes forward in the next three months, by
> July 21st, his home and possessions will be auctioned off to the
> highest bidder.

#### The situation

- HC had been corresponding with a Dr. Armitage in England via
  telegram about the spines:
  - Dr. Armitage and HC are both members of the Silver Twilight Lodge:
    a secret international society dedicated to the investigation of
    strange occurrences (Penelope did not know this)
  - These telegrams are in a hidden safe, along with the codebook to
    translate the telegrams, the remaining spines, and a Silver
    Twilight Lodge ring (silver signet ring with a house and full moon
    design).
  - In a rolodex on his desk is a business card for Carl Stanford,
    Purveyor of Antiquities and Rare Books
- Gla'aki spotted what was going on, and where, because of the
  briefly-magically-reanimated rats.
- HC was killed by servants of Gla'aki magically (he drowned while sat
  in his office)
- The coroner just reported natural causes, because what else could he
  say?  Nobody would accept "he drowned, despite being nowhere near a
  body of water, no evidence of water outside the body, and no signs
  of a struggle"
- The house is currently empty.  There are a few reanimated rats
  roaming around inside.

**Handout: Signet Ring**

> A silver signet ring with the design showing a country house and a
> full moon.

#### Dr. Armitage and the telegrams

- Dr. A. had encountered one of these spines before, found in
  Northumberland.  It had the same property of stimulating corpses,
  but far more potent.
- No idea where it came from originally, someone found it in an
  abandoned motel near a lake.
- It's got properties of both organic and inorganic materials, and
  neither seem of this world.
- Since it kills and briefly reanimates anything it's stabbed into,
  best guess is some sort of defence mechanism... but what sort of
  creature would grow spines like this he can't even fathom a guess.

**Handout: Telegrams to Dr. Armitage (summarised, translated)**

> It's a conversation between the two men about the spines.
> Dr. Armitage has seen such things before: he has in his possession
> one found "somewhere in Northumberland, near a lake with an
> abandoned motel".
>
> Dr. Armitage has been investigating the spine for years but without
> much luck: he is the one who suggested Howard look into its chemical
> composition, try putting it in water, and try injecting the fluid
> into small animals.  Your spines and Dr. Armitage's spine seems to
> be the same sort of thing, but his is more potent: the injected mice
> seem to "live" for weeks after their deaths.  He's also successfully
> performed the procedure on cats, dogs, chickens, and one badger.
>
> So far, Dr. Armitagehas been unable to fully analyse the fluid and
> determine what exactly it is doing.  But he suspects that it doesn't
> just cause muscle spasms which imitate life, he believes that it is
> actually reanimating the dead animals.  This is apparently fairly
> clear to see when you have weeks to study a single specimen.
>
> Occasionally they mention a "Carl" and "the Lodge", it seems that
> they're referring to sharing information with this Carl.

#### Carl Stanford and the Silver Twilight Lodge

- Carl will acknowledge HC as an occasional customer (holding
  something back)
- If shown the ring, he will tell about the Silver Twilight Lodge,
  describing it as an international society of ghost hunters and
  occultists - he'll make it sound like kind of a game, rather than an
  ominous secret society
- He knows everything that's happened but won't let on (he has a magic
  mirror with which he can spy on any room that contains a STL ring)
- He can point the investigators to Dr. A
- He'll also offer membership.  Joining is normally invitation-only
  but, since they knew HC and are evidently interested in this sort of
  thing... Membership is $1/mo, the conditions are to keep the society
  secret and to share any information they encounter, in retun Carl
  will pass on gossip to them.
- Secretly, the STL has some of the spines and are trying to figure
  out how to control the zombies they create.  But the investigators
  have no way to discover that.

#### Investigating the murder

The mailman:

1. Neighbours can give his name and address: Mr. James Feist lives in
   a small house a few streets away with his wife and daughter.
2. He'll tell the investigators his story if they inform him they're
   friends of Mr. Carter.

**Mr. Feist's Tale**

> I liked Mr. 'oward, 'e'd often stop and chat wi' me when I came
> 'round.  'E always 'ad parcels and letters coming from 'round the
> world: research for 'is stories 'e said.
>
> Well one day I shows up with a parcel, and 'e 'adn't collected the
> last lot from 'is doorstep yet.  There were bottles of milk
> untouched too.  "Well that's a mite queer" I thought, "Mr 'oward
> ain't the sort of man to forget to cancel 'is deliveries when 'e
> goes away."  So I got a bit worried like.
>
> I pounded on that door of 'is, but 'e didn't answer.  I went 'round
> the 'ouse lookin' in the windows, and there 'e was!  All laid out on
> the floor.  I shouted 'is name and knocked some more, but 'e didn't
> move.  I ran to Mrs. Maple's 'ouse and told 'er to ring for a
> doctor, and I went back to Mr 'oward, smashed the window, and 'opped
> inside.  'E was cold, I'm no medical man, but I could tell it was
> too late.  So I just sits there until the police and the doctor show
> up, and take 'im away.
>
> 'E was a good man, I'll be sad to see 'im gone.

The coroner:

1. Police / hospital / newspaper can give the name of the coroner who
   determined the cause of death (Mr. James Sutton)
2. The coroner hasn't gone to work for a few days
3. The coroner's address can be found in the office records - but the
   staff won't just give it away to a random member of the public
4. The coroner is at home, very drunk, and has been drunk for days:
   he's been trying to forget what he saw.

**Mr. Sutton's Tale**

> Mr. Carter... he's why I'm in this state.  Trying to forget, you
> see.  In my profession, you see a lot of horrible things.  Not
> everyone dies peacefully in their sleep.  Injury, murder, even
> disease can leave horrifying marks on the body which we coroners
> must soon become comfortable with.  It is not a trade for squeamish
> men.
>
> Nevertheless, here I am.  Trying to forget.
>
> I left my report suitably vague, merely saying that the cause of
> death is not suspicious, and that is the truth, in a sense.  The
> manner of Mr. Carter's death is perfectly common, and could happen
> to me or to you, if we are so unfortunate.  You see, he drowned.
> And it appears he drowned in freshwater: for when I cut into his
> bloated lungs, out poured the water, some small fragments of
> freshwater plants, even a tadpole.
>
> But answer me this: how could a man drown, on dry land, miles away
> from a large body of water, with no other signs of being submerged?
> No exterior marks, no traces of the same water in his stomach or
> mouth, not even a wrinkling of the fingertips!  No signs that the
> body had been moved after death, and no signs of a break-in to his
> house. It is utterly impossible that he could have filled his lungs
> with water, returned home, locked his door, and only then
> succumbed... I cannot explain it, and it scares me.

### Notes

The players did almost nothing in my prep, and spent almost the whole
session in the house, before deciding to immediately travel to England
and talk to Dr. Armitage in person.

Well, plot never survives contact with players...  they enjoyed it, at
least.

- Players go to the house:
  - They check the front door: it's locked
  - They walk around the building, and find the smashed window
    (covered in a tarp):
    - See it was broken from the outside
    - Look around for neighbours (neighbour house looks occupied, but
      nobody visible currently)
  - Rachel clambers into the study
  - She goes to find the back door (in the kitchen): it's locked
    - Finds key rack
    - Unlocks back door and lets the others in
  - All proceed to study to examine it:
    - Dill tries to figure out if the tarp was there before or after
      the murder (did someone break in and kill him?), but there's not
      enough information to tell
    - Desk is covered in books about biology and folklore:
      - One book about germ theory looks particularly well-used
      - The folklore books are all about the living dead: vampires,
        zombies, kharisiri, etc
      - Inside one book is a slip of paper with 7 numbers written on
        it
    - Behind a painting on the wall is a safe:
      - The code is the 7 numbers
      - Inside the safe is the signet ring, the code book, and the
        encoded telegrams
  - Dill and Penelope head upstairs
    - Rachel stays in the study to work on decoding the telegrams
    - Penelope has been here before, so she knows the layout
    - Nothing particularly exciting, but there is a big bundle of cash
      (enough to survive on for a few weeks at least) beneath the
      mattress of the master bedroom
    - There are rats in the walls, everywhere
  - Dill heads into the attic with a candle and a lighter
    - Rat shadows dart out of sight
    - Lots of boxes of dusty books, mostly nonfiction
  - The sun is starting to set
  - Rachel translated enough to know the telegrams are talking about
    the spines
  - Everyone goes to check out the basement:
    - Dill goes down first, ends in a wooden door and a light switch
    - Opens door, flips on light
    - Lots of rats in cages, aggressive, squeaking
    - One cage empty, has been gnawed through
    - Wooden workbench with the spines and a jar of yellow fluid
    - Rachel examines the rats: they've all got big tab wounds---the
      size of the spines---and should barely be moving, let alone
      aggressively jumping around
  - Everyone decides the house is infested with zombie rats, and has
    to be burned down
    - Spend the next few hours searching
    - Find Revelations of Gla'aki beneath study floor
    - Fill basement with dusty books from attic
    - Douse basement, stairs, and ground floor in lamp oil
    - Carry everything off to the car (including some nice silverware
      to fence)
    - Dill drops a match on the lamp oil, drives off as the house
      starts to burn
    - The house doesn't explode, thankfully; the neighbours will
      notice, but not immediately
- Everyone wonders if Howard got infected with a zombie virus by the
  escaped rats
- A few days later:
  - Penelope rings the newspaper, asking for details about Howard,
    posing (truthfully!) as a friend of his:
    - Get funeral details (a few days time)
    - Get contact details for the Providence coroner
  - Rachel shares the translated telegrams
- At the funeral:
  - Arrive early
  - Penelope thoroughly distracts the priest and one other attendee
    with a discussion about the nature of religion and the religion of
    nature
  - Dill lifts up coffin lid
  - Rachel examines body: Howard seems pretty dead, no obvious wounds
- Afterwards:
  - Telegram Dr. Armitage about meeting
  - Hop into a boat
  - Penelope spends the crossing studying the book

### Next session

In England meeting Dr. Armitage.


Gla'aki session 3, 2020-05-31
-----------------------------

### Prep

It's a beautiful summer day in London, it's early June, and you
arrived several days ago.  The city is huge, with over 7 million
people, it's the largest in the world currently.  And it is in this
vast metropolis that Dr. Armitage has proposed you meet.

In his reply to your telegram, he said that he would be conducting
some business with colleagues at the University of London, the British
Library, and the British Museum.  Something about Egyptian mummies, he
wasn't too specific.  And he has proposed a meeting at the Penhew
Foundation, an archeological institute, for 3 o'clock Thursday
afternoon, which is today!

Penelope, you've had a few more days rest, you can try a **Hard INT**
roll to learn the ritual to contact Gla'aki again if you want.

Right, what do you do?

#### The Penhew Foundation

- Info:
  - Impressive Victorian-style building in Central London, much
    grander than the buildings on either side.
  - Established in 1890 by Sir Aubrey Penhew, a renowned Egyptologist.
  - Sir Aubrey disappeared last year on an expedition, but he and the
    rest of the expedition members were recently confirmed to have
    been attacked and killed by hostile tribesmen in the African
    jungle.
  - Edward Gavigan is now the director
  - "Surely you heard of the Carlyle Massacre, it was all over the news!"
- Meeting Dr. Armitage:
  - Asking at the front desk leads the investigators to the small
    office he is temporarily using.
  - It's empty.
  - After a moment, hear two voices through a different door, door
    opens, Dr. Armitage emerges, saying "thank you, as always, for
    your support Edward; it is a pleasure working with the
    Foundation."
  - He starts, and realises that he's a little late, and who they are,
    and greets them, ushering them into his office.
- Talking to Dr. Armitage:
  - He's interested in how they got the spines (you were light on
    details with Howard).
  - And in Howard's death.
  - And in Howard's experiments.
  - And definitely in getting his book back!
  - He'll also mistake the group for a married couple and their
    daughter!
  - Ask for a **Cthulhu Mythos** roll to impress him.
  - If he's impressed, he'll be more open about the STL, otherwise
    he'll deflect it as "a fraternal organisation for those of us who
    are interested in knowledge".
  - In any case, he'll propose they go to his country estate to look
    at the other books in the set and his investigation materials.

#### Lathom House

- A large country house in Lancashire, bought by Dr. Armitage just
  before the war, when the Earl of Lathom was ruined by his gambling
  debts.
- It's a place with a lot of history: there was a wooden castle on the
  site in the 1300s, it was rebuilt as a stone castle some time in the
  1500s, but now almost all trace of that is gone, only a few bits of
  ruined wall and tower in the grounds remain, it's just a very large
  country house.
- Probably haunted.
- Dry stone wall around the buildings, with metal gates; carved into
  the walls at the gates are Elder Signs (**Spot Hidden** to notice).
- Situated a 2-hour drive from Wigan, which is a 4-hour train journey
  from London.
- Two servants: an elderly housekeeper (Mrs. Covenant) and a gardener
  / handyman (Mr. Donaldson).
- One STL member is staying: Ned Thistlewaite

#### Contacting Gla'aki

- Dr. Armitage thinks contacting Gla'aki is crazy talk but will teach
  Penelope the Elder Sign if she insists on trying it.
- If Penelope learns the ritual, she can perform it
- Nothing seems to happen
- That night she enters a sunken crystal city in her dreams, feels
  drawn towards the centre, there's a deep pit, a feeling of dread...
- Surrounding the pit are thousands of destroyed crystal shards of
  various sizes (some the size of a building).
- If she looks in the pit, Gla'aki rises: **SAN** roll, she knows what
  Gla'aki wants (freedom) and why it can't just leave (crystal
  fragments)
- Before looking in the pit, can escape with the Elder Sign.

#### The Dark Young

- Ned is examining an artefact he had sent from Alaska: a black stone
  with cuneiform scratched into it, with a black,twisted, and thorny
  wooden branch sticking out of the top.  He'll unwittingly release a
  Dark Young in the middle of the night.
- The DY won't be able to cross the border because of the Elder Signs.
- Dr. Armitage will realise that the Elder Signs protected him from
  Gla'aki, and that's why Howard died: he'll blame himself.
- Penelope won't wake up while she's in the dream.

#### Clues pointing onwards

1. **What does Gla'aki want?**

    To be free.

    Clues:

    - The vision after contacting Gla'aki
    - The Revelations of Gla'aki

2. **How can Gla'aki be freed?**

    By destroying the crystal shards.  This is revealed by any of the
    sources which reveal Clue 1.

3. **Where is Gla'aki?**

    [Loch Morar][].

    Clues:

    - Contacting Gla'aki gives a strong directional sense pointing to
      the lake.
    - If any of Dr. Armitage's reanimated animals are taken outside
      the Elder Sign wards, Gla'aki will know where they are and send
      Servants after them
    - The Revelations of Gla'aki discuss the locations of the crystal
      shards, and say that two of them will be difficult to reach
      because they are in the New World, and the Servants find ocean
      crossings difficult.

4. **Where are the crystal shards?**

    [Pingualuit crater][] in Quebec and in a university in Costa Rica.

    Clues:

    - Contacting Gla'aki gives a vague directional sense pointing to
      them.
    - The Revelations of Gla'aki says that two of the shards are in
      the New World.

If any of the clues are missed, the STL can supply this information if
the players can gain Carl Stanford's confidence.  Dr. Armitage will
suggest becoming acquainted with Carl regardless, as Carl is very
knowledgeable.

### Notes

- Players go to the Penhew Foundation:
  - They check in at the reception, and get sent to the office
    Dr. Armitage is using
  - Knocking on the door yields no response
  - Rachel goes to check out the exhibits:
    - As she looks around, she hears:
      - "Do you happen to know the time, Edward?"
      - "Why yes, it is ten past three"
      - "Oh dear!  I am late for a meeting!  I'm afraid I must go.
        Thank you, as always, for your support Edward; it is a
        pleasure working with the Foundation."
    - Rachel guesses this oldish man with white hair must be
      Dr. Armitage, meets him, and accompanies him to the office
  - Head into the office:
    - It's pretty bare, no personal items.
    - Dr. Armitage refers to them as "Mr and Mrs Temple" and Rachel as
      "your daughter" at some point, Penelope doesn't correct him
    - They talk about their experiences so far: Howard, the spikes,
      the zombies
    - Rachel rolling her eyes a lot, she thinks this is just some sort
      of bacteria causing muscle spasms in dead tissue
    - Penelope impresses Dr. Armitage with her knowledge, and he
      invites them all to come with him to his country house the next
      day to examine the other volumes of the Revelations of Gla'aki
- That night:
  - Penelope learns the ritual to contact Gla'aki
  - She decides to do it without telling the others:
    - She performs the ritual, and instantly collapses back in the bed
      asleep
    - She finds herself in a great city of crystal buildings, drawn
      towards the centre
    - She goes to the centre, sees a deep pit ringed with crystal:
      unlike the crystal buildings, these are clearly broken
      fragments, and all but two are grey and dull
    - She peers into the pit: Gla'aki rises, imparts knowledge, she
      wakes up
  - Only a few minutes have passed
  - She knows Gla'aki is trapped and the crystals are the cause
    somehow
  - She also has three directional senses: two west, very distant; one
    north, much closer
- On the train:
  - Penelope tells the others about contacting Gla'aki:
    - Rachel just thinks she's been looking at the illustrations in
      RoG too much
    - Dr. Armitage's response is "you did *what!?*"
  - Penelope spots Dr. Armitage's signet ring, matching the one Howard
    had:
    - She asks him about it, he starts to give a dismissive response,
      then says that with her experience and knowledge he thinks she
      should know the truth
    - It's a symbol of the Silver Twilight Lodge, a paranormal
      investigation society
    - Based in the US, there are a few UK members
    - Penelope wants to join, he can write a letter of recommendation
- At the house:
  - Penelope spots the elder signs carved into the gates
  - All go to the library, Dr. Armitage goes to relax:
    - All look for a book with an elder sign in, Dill finds a Latin
      translation of the Al Azif with a figure
    - Penelope starts examining volumes 2 to 6 of RoG
    - Rachel starts examining the Al Azif
    - Dill goes to get himself some refreshments, and have a look
      around
  - Dill wanders the grounds:
    - He meets Ned Thistlewaite, who Dr. Armitage mentioned in their
      trip over:
      - Ned is examining a black stone hexagon with what looks like a
        carved twisted tree branch with thorns, also black stone,
        emerging from it
      - It's got some strange runes scratched into it he is
        transcribing
      - It came from Alaska
      - Ned travels a lot---his next trip will be to India---but he
        gets artefacts sent here, so he occasionally visits for a few
        weeks to examine new findings
    - He finds Dr. Armitage:
      - They talk about the situation which brought them together some
        more
      - Dr. Armitage gives his story about how he got into this sort
        of thing: investigating a pharaoh's curse which seemed to be
        more than just superstition
      - They head to the library to see if the others have found
        anything interesting
  - In the library:
    - Rachel has transcribed and translated notes about the elder sign:
      - The printed text says it's a symbol of protection, and how to
        make one
      - The scribbled margin notes tell the story of someone who made
        an elder sign pendant, went to challenge a god, and all that
        was left of them was the pendant and the cylinder of flesh
        which had been directly behind it
      - She knows that it'll take two or three weeks to study the book
        properly
    - Penelope learned about Gla'aki:
      - How he came to Earth
      - That he creates Servants and Avatars through the spines
      - That the cult's goal is to bring the crystal shards to Gla'aki
        or his Avatars to destroy them
    - Rachel proposes they stay for a few weeks:
      - Dr. Armitage asks what she's studying
      - She manages to fast talk him into thinking it's a different
        book than the Al Azif, one much less dangerous
      - Penelope is keen to stay
      - Dill begrudgingly accepts, but says he wished they would
        consult with him before making such decisions
      - Dr. Armitage is delighted to have the company
- **Three week time skip:**
  - Rachel finishes her study of the Al Azif:
    - She learns Contact Nyarlathotep and Shrivelling
    - She has notes on how to make an Elder Sign
  - Penelope finishes her study of the Revelations of Gla'aki:
    - She learns that most of the crystals are in Europe and Africa,
      some are in the New World
    - She infers that the pulls she feels to the west are crystal
      shards, and the one to the north is Gla'aki
- At night:
  - All are woken by a roar, and a scream which is cut short
  - It came from the opposite side of the building, where Ned has a
    lab
  - Rachel sneaks over and peers into the lab:
    - She sees a Dark Young smashing through the exterior wall and
      wandering outside
    - She falls back, psychosomatically blinded by the horror
    - She becomes a believer
  - Penelope looks around the corner, sees Rachel, and drags her back
  - Dr. Armitage says he's going to have a look:
    - Dill follows cautiously
    - They get to a window on the right side of the building, and peer
      out
    - Dr. Armitage identifies it as a Dark Young
    - Says it must be the artefact Ned was studying, as the elder
      signs would prevent it from coming in from the outside
    - Says he can banish it if they get the artefact from the lab
  - Penelope sneaks into the lab:
    - She gets the artefact
    - Slips and lands in liquid
    - Looks down, and sees the shredded remains of Ned
    - She lets out an involuntary scream, and the Dark Young charges
      back to the house
  - All run:
    - Rachel, still blind, carried by Dill
    - The Dark Young smashing through the house after them
    - The house starting to collapse with all the damage
    - Dill gets pinned beneath a falling beam
    - Rachel, in her panic, calls out to Nyarlathotep for help:
      - The house explodes
      - The stars show a very different layout
      - A colour, unlike any colour they had seen before, comes
        streaking down and engulfs everything
      - The Dark Young dissolves
      - The colour dissipates, and the stars return to normal
      - Rachel is left with the feeling that a steep price will be
        demanded of her


Gla'aki session 4, 2020-06-14
-----------------------------

This session takes place after a time-skip of a few months (to be
determined at the start of the session, but at least two months), with
Rachel attending the private care clinic of Danvers State Hospital.
The scenario is set in the early days of *Genius Loci*,[^s3_gl] with
the Elder Sign ward being destroyed early during the last month of
Rachel's stay.

[^s3_gl]: From *Doors to Darkness*.

### Prep

#### What has Rachel been up to?

Read:

> Rachel has been staying in the private care facility of the Danvers
> State Hospital.  A respected psychiatric hospital, out in the
> beautiful countryside in Massachusetts near Danvers, from which it
> gets its name.  A little further afield are Arkham and Salem, and 18
> miles to the south is Boston.
>
> The director is called Dr. Berger, a friendly man who gets on well
> with all of his patients.

Figure out how long Rachel has been staying there: the underlying
insanity must be cured, but she can stay any number of months she
wants receiving additional treatment.  There will then be an
additional month in which there is no treatment (described in *the
hook* below).

Rules for private care are:

<aside class="highlight">

Once per month, roll 1d100:

- A result of 01--95 is a success: gain 1d3 SAN.  Then roll SAN and,
  if a success, any underlying insanity is cured.
- A result of 96--100 is a failure: lose 1d6 SAN.

</aside>

#### What has Dill been up to?

Read:

> Dill, you mostly go back to your normal life, and all your coworkers
> think you just had a vacation for a couple of weeks.  Your wife is
> kind of upset that you didn't take her along to England with you on
> your trip, and you can tell that your attempts to explain it away
> haven't really convinced her...  but maybe it's better she doubt you
> than think you crazy.
>
> Whenever you're out in the field though, you find yourself wondering
> if something's hiding behind the trees or beneath the waters.  You
> can convince those around you that everything is normal, but you
> can't convince yourself.

Dill can spend time with a backstory element to recover some sanity.
Rules for sanity recovery are:

<aside class="highlight">

The player should narrate how they do this, then makes a SAN roll (if
the player is using their character's key connection, they roll a
bonus die):

- If the roll is successful, the player gains 1d6 SAN.
- If unsuccessful, the player loses 1 SAN and the Keeper and player
  should revise the backstory element.

Keeper and player are encouraged to roleplay the climax of the scene.

</aside>

#### What has Penelope been up to?

Read:

> Penelope, after returning from a holiday with your daughter, you
> waste no time in presenting yourself at the buildings of the Silver
> Twilight Lodge, holding onto the letter of introduction Dr. Armitage
> wrote for you.
>
> By the way, Dr. Armitage was able to explain away the complete
> destruction of his country house and the death of Ned to the police
> as the result of an undetected a gas leak.
>
> You meet Carl Stanford, the founder of the Lodge, and he welcomes
> you into the fold as a new member.  He explains a bit about the
> society to you: he says that it is more of a "society with secrets"
> than a "secret society", if you see his meaning; a lot of the
> members of the society don't *truly* believe in the occult, they
> treat the society as a kind of gentlemen's club where they can meet
> to discuss science, philosophy, and such matters.  Most people don't
> progress beyond this outer circle but, those who show true belief,
> and aptitude, are invited into the inner circle, where they gain
> access to secret knowledge and to information about the society's
> activities: archaeological expeditions, restoration of mouldering
> old tomes, looking into ghost stories, that sort of thing.  With
> your letter of recommendation, you are immediately admitted into
> this inner circle.
>
> One day you are browsing the parts of the society's library which
> are open to the outer circle.  There's nothing really about the
> mythos here, and as you're flicking through a book about headhunter
> cults in the Amazon basin, a middle-aged black man approaches you,
> offers you his hand to shake, and greets you.  He introduces himself
> as Jackson Elias, a member of the society currently in town.
>
> **Roll intelligence.**

On a pass, read:

> You recognise his name: it's the name printed on the book you are
> reading!  You spend a little time talking about the book, and some
> others he's written.  He says he likes to infiltrate cults if he
> can, to expose their secrets to the world.  Through your
> conversation you get the impression that he doesn't really believe
> in the occult at all, he thinks of these cults as mostly being tools
> of political and personal power.
>
> As he heads off, he tells you to keep an eye out for his next book,
> which will be about Asian and African death cults.

On a fail, read:

> With a slight smirk, he asks how you're enjoying the book.  You
> spend a little time talking about it, he recommends a few other
> books on cults, and says that he's heard the author is planning to
> write a book on Asian and African death cults next.
>
> As he walks away, you close the book, reach towards the shelf to put
> it away, and spot the name of the author on the cover.  Jackson
> Elias.  You look up, and see him peeking back at you from the end of
> the shelves, and as your eyes meet, he nods, turns around, and walks
> off while chuckling quietly.

Penelope can also spend time with a backstory element to recover some
sanity.

#### Development phase

Rules for investigator development:

<aside class="highlight">

For each skill checked, roll 1d100.  If you fail, gain 1d10 points in
it.  Then uncheck the skills.

If a skill reaches 90% or more, gain 2d6 SAN, representing the
discipline and self-esteem gained by mastering a skill.

</aside>

#### The hook

Read:

> Rachel, during your last month at the hospital, things got a bit
> weird.  It all began on the day they started building the
> ampitheatre.
>
> The ampitheatre was one of Dr. Berger's ideas: a little stage and
> some tiered seats, built on the side of the hill, facing a reservoir
> and the beautiful countryside, where there would be poetry readings,
> speeches, and plays.  The newspapers had complained about the
> expense to the taxpayer, but Dr. Berger had fought back by saying
> that just because the patients of the hospital couldn't integrate
> with society, they shouldn't be deprived of culture.  And if
> anything, this would help people to heal.
>
> This whole debate was before you arrived, plans were drawn up during
> your stay, and then one day, early in the last month of your stay, a
> team of patients who had volunteered to assist with the construction
> had gone out to start clearing the ground.  After they'd been out
> there for a few hours, something weird happens.
>
> **Roll POW**

On a pass, read:

> You suddenly feel a chill down your spine.

On a fail, read:

> You suddenly feel a strange mental pressure, not unlike when you
> made contact with the Lord of Many Faces.
>
> **Take 1 SAN damage.**

Then read:

> You hear the distinctive sound of a teacup smashing, and look over
> to see that one of the nurses has stumbled and lost her grip on a
> tray she was carrying, and one of the other patients looks like he's
> seen a ghost.  It seems you weren't the only one who felt something.
>
> Over the next several nights, you have a strange dream...
>
> Every night, the same dream, getting a little further each time, and
> on the final night, you experience the full thing.
>
> > You're outdoors, it's chilly, and there's thick mist, you can't see
> > more than a couple of meters.  You seem to be on hard dry soil,
> > surrounded by sparse stalks of tall grass.  You hear a distant voice
> > calling your name, and you feel drawn towards it.  The mist clings
> > to you, you almost have to fight through at times.
> >
> > Eventually, tired from your struggle, you emerge from the tall
> > grasses and see a man: tall, gaunt, and dark.  An inverted ankh
> > blazes on his forehead.  He holds out his hands.  In his left palm
> > is your face.  In his right palm is a strange, twisted, hourglass.
> >
> > The man then brings his hands together, and you feel yourself float
> > off the ground, up into the sky, and up into space.  You stop before
> > a collection of monstrous figures: some like twisted humans, some
> > like animals, others of no particular shape at all.  All of them,
> > and you, orbit a pulsating ball of yellow energy, which you somehow
> > recognise as being the man who was calling you.  The ball draws you
> > in, you become part of it and it becomes part of you, and you see
> > through different eyes the void of space.  A great triangle appears
> > in the void, twisted, in a way which reminds you of the hourglass.
> > You hear the voice say "The price must be paid.  A moment of your
> > time.  When the time is right."  and you wake up.
>
> Despite the strangeness of the dream, it doesn't feel like a
> nightmare.
>
> Things have been getting strange in the hospital too: a lot of
> people have been discharged, and a lot moved to higher-security
> wards, used for violent inmates.  One of those moved is a gentle old
> man you've grown to know during your stay, a Mr. Henry Akeley.  He's
> suffering from dementia, and forgets things a lot, but is otherwise
> completely harmless.  One day he just didn't show up in the common
> room.  And all the staff have said is that he is "too excitable" at
> the moment.  He didn't have any family left, so your daily chats
> were one of the few things keeping him going.
>
> **Roll intelligence.**

On a pass, read:

> You realise that everyone who has had a recent visitor has been
> discharged.

Then read:

> Dr. Berger has been acting irritable, and the staff have seemed
> almost afraid of him.  One day, one of the nurses told you that
> Dr. Berger wanted to see you in his office.  This is unusual, as
> previously he visited the people he needed to talk to, and then
> invited them to his office if it was a private matter.
>
> So you went to his office, and he quite bluntly asked you to leave
> the hospital.  He said you had been treated, and were just taking up
> space which could be used for new patients.  This is a stark change
> to his previous attitude, which was to let you stay as long as you
> felt you were benefiting from it.
>
> He had you write a letter with him, right there and then, asking
> Penelope and Dill to come and take you back to your home as soon as
> possible.
>
> In the several days it took for the letters to be delivered,
> Penelope and Dill to talk, and to then come to pick you up, the
> strangeness continued.
>
> Now we're going to start the session with Penelope and Dill arriving
> to collect Rachel.

#### The situation

- Dr. Berger has unwittingly freed a lloigor with the construction of
  the ampitheatre:
  - On the site chosen for the ampitheatre was a granite disk bearing
    an Elder Sign, which was keeping it at bay.
  - Dr. Berger saw no value in the disk, and had the patients clearing
    the ground smash it up and carry the pieces away.
- The lloigor is weak from its long imprisonment:
  - It then expended almost all of its power to enslave Dr. Berger and
    to make the staff more obedient to him
  - It plans to turn the residents into its cult:
    - A ritual will be held on the New Moon following Rachel's release
      to feed it with magic points.
    - Henry Akeley has been chosen as the sacrifice.  The following
      day, Dr. Berger will announce that he died of a heart attack in
      his sleep.  He is old, so it won't be suspicious.

  - Get ushered to Dr. Berger's office by a receptionist:
    - He sends a nurse to fetch Rachel.
    - Penelope notices Dr. Berger looks stressed and tired.
    - He says he's just been a bit overworked lately.
    - Rachel arrives, he turns the conversation to her release papers.
    - Penelope and Dill sign the papers, and leave with Rachel.
- Rachel tells them about the weirdness.
- They go to check out the construction site:
  - The water is silvery, but otherwise seems normal.
- They go to look around and talk to people:
  - Encounter Chalkman: he's unresponsive and just stares blankly at
    them.
  - See two old people talking, Rachel approaches:
    - Old man knew Henry, he was screaming murder one day and had to
      be restrained for his safety.
- Go to do some research:
  - Dill `->` Danvers Town Hall:
    - Handout: floorplan.
    - Learns: bureaucratic details.
  - Rachel `->` Danvers Library:
    - Handout: Dr. Shine leaving.

- Go to Salem:
  - Penelope remembers some details about Dr. Shine (and that he is
    dead).
  - Get into the hospital archives:
    - Handout: Dr. Shine's notes.
- Go back to the asylum:
  - Examine the construction site and find where the disk was.
  - Go to the reception to ask where they might have put it:
    Dr. Berger is there, avoid!
  - Go to the records office:
    - Dill blags his way in.
    - Examines their permits to learn what's done with the
      construction waste (dump off the hill).
  - Go to the dump:
    - Dill shoved by an unseen force, almost falls down the hill.
    - Find a fragment of the disk, dig it out, it's part of an Elder
      Sign.
    - Go to the construction site to get some shovels:
      - See Chalkman.
      - He tries to grab Rachel, but stops following when she gets too
        far away.
      - His blank expression is now anger.
      - Every time Rachel gets close he tries to grab her, but
        eventually stops.
    - Encounter two orderlies at the dump:
      - Dill fails at fast talking them.
      - They tell him to leave, and to not wander around the grounds
        without permission from Dr. Berger.
- Return that night:
  - One person watches for patrols, the other two dig.
  - Get all the pieces out around dawn.
  - Drive back to the hotel in Danvers.
- Penelope confronted by Andrew MacBride:
  - Tells his story.
  - Disappears into the dawn.
  - Two nights from now Dr. Berger will use Henry for something!


Gla'aki session 5, 2020-06-28
-----------------------------

### Recap

> Last time Penelope and Dill arrived at Danvers Asylum to collect
> Rachel, who was being discharged under unusual circumstances.
> Something seemed up with Dr. Berger and the rest of the staff, and
> you found that recently construction work had destroyed an Elder
> Sign on the asylum grounds.  You found that the ward had been placed
> by Dr. Shine, the previous superintendent, and who had felt unable
> to tell Dr. Berger of its true purpose.
>
> You learned, from an inmate who had been sent to deal with you, that
> some sort of ritual is planned for the night of the New Moon: which
> is tomorrow!  The ritual somehow involves a gentle old man Rachel
> had befriended during her stay, and who is now being in one of the
> high security wards for violent patients.

### Prep

#### Plans to deal with the situation

1. Create a large distraction (eg, fire or evacuation)

    This isn't a solution, it's a means to a solution.

2. Disrupt the ritual

    - Sneak to the site on the ritual night
    - Find where the ritual is being held

    Unlikely to solve the lloigor problem, even if the kill Berger.

3. Call upon a god

    - Nyarlathotep: can do whatever the investigators want if they pay
      the price (eg, becoming his servant)
    - Gla'aki: likely to send Servants to negotiate with the lloigor
      for aid escaping

    This seems like a bad idea to me.

4. Spontaneous use of Cthulhu Mythos

    Can achieve any effect, but can also be very fatal.  This also
    seems like a bad idea to me.

5. Create an Elder Sign

    Someone needs to learn the spell!  Can try Hard INT daily.

    This would solve the problem and restore everyone.  But can they
    convince Berger to leave it in place?

    **Clue:** Elder Sign cuts off Penelope's Gla'aki sense.

6. Incapacitate Berger

    This will delay the start of the ritual, while the lloigor whips
    them into a frenzy unaided, but won't really solve anything.

7. Break out Rachel's friend Henry and hope for the best

    Someone else will be used.  But maybe that's good enough?

8. Ask the Silver Twilight Lodge for help

    They can probably get an Elder Sign or some other ward.

#### Sneaking into Danvers Asylum

Random encounters:

1. Encounter with orderlies
2. Encounter with nurses
3. Encounter with patients
4. Lloigor attack (shove, trip, etc)
5. Lloigor help (door unlocks, orderlies distracted before seeing investigators, etc)
6. Lloigor sighting (lizard crawling into a pool, chalk drawing, etc)
7. Oppressive atmosphere: lose 0/1 SAN
8. Physical barrier (door, ditch, etc)
9. Nothing happens!
10. Reroll!

Creepy descriptions:

- Dark, long, corridors
- Echoes
- Stout, locked, doors with barred windows
- The sound of quiet crying / laughing in the distance
- A scream
- No artificial lights, windows above the doors
- Seating area to catch the sunlight
- Nurse room: office, medical supplies
- Patient room: plain, undecorated, nothing sharp, small cot, restraints
- Kitchen / serving room: sterile, metal, utensils
- Bathroom: small bathtub, sponges

### Notes

- Planning what to do:
  - Penelope, 8: ask the STL for help
  - Rachel, 5: create an Elder Sign
  - Dill: submit a false report of money mismanagement, to get the
    asylum investigated.
- That evening:
  - Penelope returned with Russell Gibson, knows some simple healing /
    warding magic, doesn't like the idea of people being in danger.
  - Rachel figured out the ritual.
  - Rachel embroiders an Elder Sign into her jacket and magics it:
    - She sees it glow (nobody else does)
    - Feels weak and drained
    - Penelope's Gla'aki sense cut off:
      - Total cut-off in a half-mile radius, then gradual fade for a
        half-mile beyond that
- Next day:
  - Confirm the Elder Sign cuts off all magic in the vicinity by
    having Russell try making the Powder of Ibn-Ghazi, which fails.
  - Decide to sneak into the asylum at night, hide the Elder Sign
    jacket somewhere, then go to the ampitheatre and see what happens;
    only intervene if necessary.
- That night:
  - Sneak into the grounds and to the main building.
  - Penelope spotted by a creepy patient in a flash of lightning.
  - Penelope sneaks into the ward building to look for a hiding spot:
    - Dark, no artificial light.
    - Quiet, some distant laughter.
    - Nobody around.
    - Listen at one door: hear orderlies chatting.
    - Open another door: discover a sleeping nurse.
    - Open another door: creaks, and the orderlies come to
      investigate.
    - Sneak up to the attic before the orderlies arrive.
    - Hide the jacket on one of the beams.
    - Sneak back down to ground floor, avoiding the orderlies checking
      on all the patients.
    - Patients are awake: gibbering, talking, crying, laughing,
      reaching through the bars...
    - Swiftly exit and lock the door behind her.
  - Meanwhile, Rachel sneaks to the ampitheatre:
    - Sees Dr. Berger, other staff and patients, Henry on a gurney,
      walking towards it.
    - All look confused, as if they're trying to remember something,
      or as if they're not really sure what's going on.
    - Carrying blue flamed-torches.
  - All reunite at the ampitheatre; and watch:
    - Dr. Berger tries to address the crowd a few times, but looks
      like he doesn't know what he wants to say.
    - Eventually he talks about how something strange has been
      happening for the last month, almost like a waking dream, he and
      other staff have memory gaps... and no idea why they're out here
      tonight.  Maybe the food?  Or water?  Or a gas leak?  Let's all
      go back inside.
    - Henry taken in by a nurse.
  - Return to the hotel, the immediate problem solved.
- Next day:
  - Penelope sends Russell tot he STL to talk about donating a statue
    or something, providing a new permanent Elder Sign.
  - Go to visit the asylum:
    - Dr. Berger apologises for his treatment of Rachel towards the
      end of her stay.
    - Chat with Henry in the common room.  Dill asks some questions
      about what he remembers:
      - He had a dream[^s5_0] that Dr. Shine had never come to the
        asylum.
      - It's ok now, the bad dream went away.
      - In the dream he was going to go on a trip "to the seaside, I
        think"
  - Dill cancels his fraud report.
- Gla'aki brainstorming:
  - Maybe Elder Signing a crystal will prevent it from holding Gla'aki
    and freeing him?[^s5_2]
  - The RoG only talked about his loyal servants, not zombies!
  - What do these servants do?  They fetch crystals and spread the
    influence of Gla'aki to distant lands.[^s5_1]
  - We should free Gla'aki so he'll go away and stop zombifying
    people.

[^s5_0]: This is a confused memory of the time before Dr. Shine---when
  the lloigor was last loose---and recent events.  The "trip to the
  seaside" was about being taken to the reservoir.

[^s5_1]: Spread influence by creating Avatars.

[^s5_2]: This is the exact opposite of what I planned originally, but
  it's cool if they want to free Gla'aki.

### Next time

Visiting [Pingualuit crater][].


Gla'aki session 6, 2020-07-10
-----------------------------

### Recap

> Last session Rachel mastered the magic of the Elder Sign, and you
> discovered that an Elder Sign suppressed all magic in a large area
> around it.  Penelope's Gla'aki sense is completely cut off up to
> half a mile away, and only regains full strength a full mile away.
>
> And so, you decided to use this new-found magic to deal with
> Gla'aki's crystals, hoping to disable the remaining two for long
> enough for Gla'aki to escape the Earth and return to the stars.
>
> Penelope has spent the last two weeks travelling around the states
> with a map and a stash of pencils, trying to get a more precise fix
> on the locations of the crystals.  And now she's got it.  One lies
> to the north, in Quebec; the other to the south, in Central America.
> Where do you want to go?

### Prep (Quebec)

![Handout: Penelope's best guess for the crystal's location](campaign-notes-2020-05-call-of-cthulhu/quebec.png)

#### There and back again

There are two ways to reach the crater, both starting from Quebec
City.

In both cases, the more honest locals will refuse to have anything to
do with this fools errand, unless the investigators can convince them
that they are fit and knowledgeable enough to handle a long trek into
the wilderness and back (to an unspecified destination, for
unspecified purpose!), so only the dishonest ones will assist them.

David Spencer, a Servant of Gla'aki, is available in both locations to
supply what they need.

**Catch a boat to Fort Chimo then travel over land:**

- 300 miles (at best a 5-day journey with dogs)
- David Spencer will sell them a dog sled and supplies.  He'll set a
  high price but can be haggled down.  The dogs don't like him.

**Travel over land from Quebec City:**

- 1000 miles (at best a 20 day journey with a truck)
- David Spencer will sell them a truck and supplies.  He'll set a high
  price but can be haggled down.

**Gossip in Quebec City or Fort Chimo:**

- "You don't look much like hunters or fur traders."
- "It's empty out there, just barren land."
- "...there's some sort of Esquimaux holy site, it's creepy, best to
  stay away."
- "If the bears don't get you those Esquimaux will."
- David Spencer might sell you his truck/dogs/supplies."

**The journey itself:**

- Cold
- Constant wind
- Barren, sporadic clumps of trees, but mostly rocks, hills, rivers,
  and small lakes.
- There are three big rivers, running W/E, between Port Chimo and
  Pingualuit Crater.
- To the west: lots of little lakes, no rivers.
- To the east: lots of little lakes, many small rivers running N/S+E.
- On the return journey (without Gla'aki-sense) call for Navigation
  checks to avoid getting lost.

**Encounters:**

- Recently deserted Esquimaux camp
- Polar bears
- Sounds of nearby gunshots or fighting at night
- Bad weather
- Dark Young
- A river or lake to move around
- An injured dog or damaged truck
- A misplaced treasured possession

**Campfire conversation starters:**

- Have you been on a journey like this before?
- What are you taking / how are you preparing?
- What habits of the others are annoying you?
- Everyone share a story.
- What exactly do you plan to do when you get there?
- What if the crystal is buried or underwater?
- Why are you doing this?

#### Pingualuit Crater

The crater is a big change from the surrounding environs.  Full of
life, and at the centre a deep lake housing the brilliant blue/green
crystal which pulses with an inner light.

- Green, fertile, lush, warm
- Heavily forested
- Oddly quiet (with a Listen check)
- Crystal at bottom of central lake
- Signs of a very ancient, and recently abandoned, settlement
- Stone pillar with a representation of Gla'aki
- Dark Young

**Encounters:**

- At night:
  - A Dark Young is heard (cough/bark which turns into a shriek)
- After the Elder Sign is placed:
  - Dark Young sound, loud thumping, trees swaying
  - "Trees" relocate outside the crater
  - David Spencer, with a gun and a line of sight to where they were
    working, found dead (Medicine confirms he's been dead for months)
- If they refuse to place the Elder Sign:
  - David Spencer confronts them

### Prep (Central America)

![Handout: Penelope's best guess for the crystal's location](campaign-notes-2020-05-call-of-cthulhu/central-america.png)

![Handout: The San José Herald, an English daily newspaper](campaign-notes-2020-05-call-of-cthulhu/san-jose-herald.png)

#### The Jade Museum

It's a large modern building in the centre of San José, built in 1890,
which houses several hundred pieces of pre-Columbian jade artefacts.
The blue/green crystal, which pulses with an inner light, is inside
one of the broken spheres.

- The basement:
  - Dark, long corridors
  - Some labs
  - Storage room with the spheres
  - Crystal in a broken sphere
- Guards patrol at night
- One of the guards is a Servant:
  - He'll watch the investigators without getting in their way (unless
    he thinks they're going to do something detrimental)
- Basement access through building, or through coal chute at the back
- Exhibits:
  -  Threshold: A look at the ecological and historical contexts that
     lead to the rise of jade societies.
  -  Jade: The craft, economics, and trade of jade stone and artifacts
     in ancient Mesoamerica.
  -  The Day: Daily life of Pre-Columbian societies in Costa Rica.
  -  The Night: The uses of jade in religion, war, and burial rites.
  -  Memory: A celebration of the cultural music, history, and
     technology.
  -  The Collection: Jade art from three regions: Greater Nicoya,
     Central Region, Greater Chiriqui.
  -  7000+ artefacts, from 500--300BC

**Encounters:**

- If they refuse to place the Elder Sign:
  - The Guard-Servant confront them
- After they place the Elder Sign:
  - The Guard-Servant found dead snooping outside the storage room
    (Medicine confirms he's been dead for months)


### Prep (The Aftermath)

![Handout: Scotland Destroyed! Earthquake Shatters Nation!](campaign-notes-2020-05-call-of-cthulhu/the-aftermath.png)

After disabling the crystals, Gla'aki will rise from his earthly
prison and return to the stars, taking the minds of his believers with
him, leaving their bodies acting as rabid beasts.

### Notes

I expected the players to get through one location and maybe make
travel arrangements for the other, and then to have a shorter next
session and spend the time afterwards talking about where we want the
campaign to go to next.  But we got through both locations in a
slightly longer session, as they bypassed almost all of the Quebec
events by deciding to charter a flight.

- Players head to Panama:
  - Dill and Penelope learn how to make an Elder Sign during the
    journey.
  - Penelope senses the crystal moving, somewhere in Costa Rica.
  - Rachel fails to smuggle her gun through customs, it gets
    confiscated, they head to Panama City to find a guitar case to
    hide it in so they can smuggle it into Costa Rica.
  - Penelope finds the newspaper and learns about the stone spheres.
  - MoN Egypt hotel scenario:
    - They spot the hidden entrances to their rooms, move into one
      room, keep watch, and surprise the thief.
- Players head to Costa Rica:
  - Pick up Rachel's gun as they leave Panama, and smuggle it into
    Costa Rica.
  - Head to San Jose, and find a reputable hotel.
  - Scope out the Jade Museum:
    - Crystal is in the basement somewhere.
    - Rachel causes a distraction, Penelope and Dill sneak down.
    - Penelope finds the room, but it's occupied.
    - Caught and made to leave.
  - That night:
    - Just one guard.
    - Scope out the surroundings, make a plan to break in.
  - The following night:
    - Just the one, same, guard.
    - Break in.
    - Sneak through basement to crystal room, avoiding guard patrol.
    - Steal crystal, and escape
- Players return to the US:
  - Crystal baked into a loaf of bread and smuggled out through
    customs.
  - Take the crystal to Danvers as an experiment: it cools and stops
    glowing when in range of the Elder Sign.
  - Go chat with the STL about chartering a flight to the Quebec
    crystal:
    - Failed a Psychology roll on Carl Stanford.
    - Sure, they can have a plane.
- Players head to Quebec, with their crystal:
  - Silent, forested, oddly warm and green (etc)
  - Find the deserted camp:
    - Been inhabited for a long time, centuries at least
    - Looks recently abandoned, but can't track the footprints
      through the grass and trees
    - Stone obelisk at the centre with Gla'aki carvings
  - Hear a Dark Young at night
  - Make an Elder Sign and drop it onto the crystal in the lake:
    - Keeping their other crystal out of range.
    - Dark Young call and swaying trees when they activate their Elder
      Sign.
    - Air cools as the rock sinks to the crystal.
  - No way to get the crystal out of the lake:
    - Plan to carve an Elder Sign into a rock and drop it onto the
      crystal.
    - Penelope makes an Elder Sign, Dill makes a raft.
    - Lake water is warm but otherwise seems normal.
    - Dark Young call and swaying trees when the Elder Sign activates.
- Players return to the US:
  - See trees have moved from the air.
  - Penelope casts Contact Gla'aki alone at night:
    - He uses Dominate to make her want to immediately Elder Sign the
      remaining crystal.
    - She does, senses Gla'aki disappear after a little while.
  - Next morning:
    - People on the street engrossed by the newspaper, some look
      distraught.
    - Scotland Destroyed!

**Feedback:** they mentioned some bits about the arc they particularly
liked:

- "Suspense in the museum basement was nice" "Hell yeah."
- "I also really enjoyed sneaking around in the asylum and the
  museum."
- "Personally I still can't stop grinning when remembering the time I
  invoked Nyarly in the house, what a moment."
- "I did enjoy the sneaky bits a good deal."
- "I appreciated our little Panama detour"

### Next time

Under discussion, but the likely option seems to be playing through
the Peru chapter of MoN with Pulp Cthulhu rules, and Nyarlathotep
calling in his deal with Rachel.


MoN Peru session 1, 2020-07-26
------------------------------

### Prep

- Quick run through of Pulp rules
- Do character creation (preserving Cthulhu Mythos points)
- Overturn Elder Sign ruling

### Notes

- Penelope agreed to play along with Jackson Elias's deception, he
  spilled the beans with Rachel and Kints too.
- Kints spots Pedro de Valesco watching them from an alley.
- Find Rizo's body, + her notes, + the golden band in the store room:
  - But don't see the burned skin fragments.
- Rachel / Elias find Mendoza's stabbing victim then save Sanchez and
  knock out Mendoza:
  - But after Sanchez had been infected.
  - Rachel noticed the moving lump inside Sanchez.

### Next time

Penelope and Kints are in the store room with Rizo's body.  Rachel and
Jackson are with the injured Prof. Sanchez and the unconscious
Mendoza.  Rachel fired her shotgun indoors, so the police will be on
their way.


MoN Peru session 2, 2020-08-09
------------------------------

### Recap

> Last time you all met up in the Bar Cordano, in Lima, Peru, to go on
> an expedition to find a previously undiscovered pyramid somewhere in
> the Andean highlands.
>
> There you met Augustus Larkin---your patron---a sickly looking man
> who sweats a lot and, as Rachel noticed, seemed to be suffering from
> opioid withdrawal.  Also there were Luis de Mendoza, Larkin's gaunt
> and untalkative assistant; and Jackson Elias---going by the alias
> Jesse Hughes---professional investigator of cults and known to
> Penelope from the Silver Twilight Lodge.
>
> Larkin showed you some golden artefacts he claimed were from the
> pyramid, and wasn't very subtle in hinting that finding it and
> bringing back its treasures would be of great financial benefit to
> you all.
>
> After Larkin and Mendoza left, Jackson revealed his identity and
> confided that he thinks there's more to this expedition that meets

> the local museum, and Mendoza has a reputation as a kharisiri: a
> kind of local vampire which sucks the fat from its victim's bodies.
> Legends of the kharisiri date back to the conquistadors, and they
> are always gaunt white men, so Jackson thinks there might be a
> centuries-old cult to investigate here.
>
> The following day, you went to meet Professor Sanchez and his
> assistant Trinidad Rizo at the local museum, who have been trying to
> find this pyramid to send a team before Larkin---they don't believe
> in this cult stuff, but they do think Larkin is basically a
> grave-robber.  Then disaster struck!  Rizo went to fetch her notes
> and an artefact believed to be from the pyramid, she didn't return,
> and you found her buried beneath a pile of broken boxes in the
> basement, her body thin and withered as if all the fat had been
> removed.  Rachel went to inform Jackson and the professor, but was
> distracted by a scream from outside: a woman had been stabbed, and
> by the time she got back to the professor's office, he had been
> attacked by Mendoza.  Rachel and Jackson managed to knock out
> Mendoza, despite him vomiting forth a long tentacle with pincers on
> the end which tried to latch onto Rachel, and then found that he had
> "kissed" the professor, and there was something moving around inside
> the professor's abdomen...
>
> Kints and Penelope, you're in the basement storeroom with Rizo's
> body, her notes on the *Final Confessions of Gaspar Figueroa*, and a
> golden artefact which seems to be the one described in the notes.
> Rachel, you're with Jackson, Professor Sanchez, and the unconscious
> Luis de Mendoza in the professor's office.  The professor is in a
> great deal of pain, and has something crawling around inside him.
>
> Let's go to Kints and Penelope in the basement first.  You've heard
> some gunshots, what do you do?

### Prep

- Jackson can arrange a boat to the coast near Puno if the heroes want
  to leave before Monday (or disable Larkin and can't persuade the
  trucks to drive them).  The crossing takes a few days and then the
  train journey is another day.

- If the heroes leave it too long after killing Mendoza, Larkin will
  come to find them.  He will try to get one of them alone, and
  Nyarlathotep will then take over to cast Cloud Memory and make them
  forget.

- Rachel would be unsettled to hear Nyarlathotep's voice.

- Mendoza isn't dead.  They can only truly kill a kharisiri by utterly
  destroying its body (acid, fire, etc).

- People in Puno will stare at and be wary of the white heroes.

- Pedro de Valesco (white) and a few of the new local kharisiri will
  be in Puno.

- Spells that may be useful for Nyarlathotep:

  - **Cloud Memory** (KR#250): block a specific memory in the mind of
    the target.
  - **Dominate** (KR#254): briefly bend the will of the target to the
    caster.
  - **Fist of Yog-Sothoth** (KR#259): strike a target with an
    invisible force and propel them backwards, with a chance to knock
    them unconscious.
  - **Summon Hunting Horror** (KR#263): physically brings a Hunting
    Horror (KR#299, about as massive as a cape buffalo).

  Note that Nyarlathotep needs to use the heroes to destroy the golden
  ward, he doesn't want to kill them unless they're about to destroy
  his vessel Larkin.

- Don't forget about bonus dice for distracted or outnumbered foes!

### Notes

- Rachel blows up Mendoza's head
- Penelope clairvoyances the location of the pyramid
- Visit Prof Sanchez in the hospital:
  - Kints spots Pedro de Valesco watching the room
  - He describes the maggot
- Penelope sneaks into Larkin's room, taking the mask and all his
  money.
- Larkin feigns ignorance over what happened with Mendoza, saying the
  expedition must continue.
- Penelope detects rotting meat smell.
- Set off to Puno the night before Larkin, taking a faster route
  (arriving a full day before he will).
- Find Nayra in the floating island:
  - Folklore:
    - Knows about the tentacles (kharisiri scoop out the fat with
      their long tongue), doesn't know about the maggot or kiss.
    - Kharisiri attacks have been getting worse, people have been
      attacked in the city.
    - Thinks Mendoza is after her, people have been watching her
      house.
    - Identifies the mask as of Tiwanaku origin (which is roughly this
      area).
    - Tells the legend of the god.
  - Rachel spots kharisiri outside!
  - Kints attacks one, severing its tentacle (5HP damage), sees other
    two emerge from the shadows.

### Next time

Start with a luck refresh and the kharisiri fight on the reed island.
Nayra should point out that these kharisiri look like locals, not
white people.  They might also discover the pot bellies full of liquid
fat.

### Prep

- Back at Prof. Armitage's country house, Nyarlathotep saved Rachel in
  exchange for "a moment of your time," this session he will come to
  collect:
  - At the pyramid, he will possess Rachel (no roll), slip back, and
    open a gate for Larkin and Mendoza (`1/1d6+1` SAN) to pass
    through.
  - If Penelope / Kints notice and come to find Rachel, she is
    chanting "words which don't sound like anything a human mouth
    should be making," her eyes completely black (`1d3` SAN).
  - The gate will emit a blinding purple light, noise of a
    thunderclap, and really strong wind.  So it's not subtle.
  - Nyarlathotep will leave Rachel (hard CON to avoid fainting) and
    take Larkin: he will straighten, suddenly looking stronger and
    more confident, his eyes black, and he will speak in a deep voice:
    - "Enough of this chase.  You two will enter the pyramid and
      remove the golden seal, or this one will a sacrifice to my
      glory." (Penelope & Rachel hear this in English, Kints in
      Spanish)
    - Rachel recognises this voice as the voice of Nyarlathotep.
    - If she failed the hard CON, she now faints.  Mendoza stands over
      her, hand on sword.
    - If she passed the hard CON, Mendoza grapples her with a bonus
      for her weakened state.
  - Then switch viewpoints to Penelope / Kints and describe how Rachel
    looked to them through this.

### Notes

- Kharisiri fight on Nayra's island:
  - Rachel spots them healing
  - Rachel remembers the maggot and figures out that's how they spread
  - They decide to burn the corpses
- Feral kharisiri encounter - they burn the corpse
- Farmer encounter - he points confirms the kharisiri went to the
  pyramid (backed up by clairvoyance)
- The pyramid:
  - Watch the kharisiri through binoculars (gross)
  - Nyarly happens, sends Penelope and Kints into the tunnels.
  - P & K set the fat on fire
  - Rachel withers Larkin to death
  - P & K repair the seal with the Gla'aki crystal
  - Kharisiri crumble to dust
  - Steal some of the loose gold
  - Rachel looks into the mirror:
    - Contacts Nyarlathotep, he gloats that his plans will inevitably
      succeed
    - She goes slightly mad, attacks the seal
    - Kints restrains her

### Next time

We're playing a Traveller one-shot, which I expect to take two
sessions.


MoN America session 1, 2020-09-20
---------------------------------

### Time skip / Hero Development Phase

1. Set HP and MP to full
2. Luck recovery:
   - Roll, +2d10+10 on failure, +1d10+5 on success.
3. Gain skills:
   - Roll, +1d10 on failure.
4. Recover sanity:
   - Spend time with backstory, roll SAN, +1d10 on success, -1 and
     revise backstory on failure.
   - With a key connection use a bonus die and cure indefinite
     insanity.
5. Review credit ratings:
   - They had pack animals, so assume everyone was bumped to CR49
     (with an extra $2k in assets) at the end of Peru.
   - Talk about what everyone was up to in the intervening 5 years and
     revise up or down.
6. Learn languages:
   - If anyone lived in another country they gain Language (Other) at
     30 for 2+ years or 50 for 3+ years.

### Prep

- Overview of Carlyle Expedition + go through newspaper clippings
- Where would they go to await Jackson's message?  They don't know
  where he is, so it's got to be somewhere he knows and where they can
  hang out all day.
  - Do any of them live in New York?
  - Or a favoured hotel?
  - A speakeasy?
  - Something else?
  - Ask and improv the phonecall scene:
    - Jackson's audibly nervous
    - Sets a meeting place and time (8PM, room 410 at the Hotel
      Chelsea)
    - He doesn't answer any questions, hangs up if pressed, and
      doesn't answer if called back.
    - If visited early he's not in (reception can confirm an African
      American man went out around the time the call ended).

### Notes

- Room 410:
  - They killed one cultist, the other escaped.
  - Lt. Poole now has the car's description and their contact details.
  - Rachel identified the Bloody Tongue symbol on Jackson's forehead.
- Research:
  - Talked to Arthur Emerson, he told them about Ju-Ju House and to be careful.
  - Rachel got Bloody Tongue background from the library.
  - And found that Roger Carlyle had checked out "Life as a God" but never returned it.
  - Cassie leaves a message for Prof. Cowles: an "urgent matter" relating to his lecture.
- Ju-Ju House:
  - Asked Silas about Jackson and the Bloody Tongue.
  - He said he didn't know Jackson and that the Bloody Tongue was a story to scare children.

### Next time

The funeral.


MoN America session 2, 2020-10-18
---------------------------------

### Recap

Who wants to give it?

### Prep

#### Leads they think they have

##### The Carlyle Expedition / Erica Calyle

- They can find out more about Roger and Bunay from Erica Calyle
  **(p132)**
- They can find gossip about the expedition members from newspaper
  articles, peers, or Erica Carlyle **(p139)**

##### Bloody Tongue headbands

- Police haven't seen these before, don't know what they are (not on
  the guy they have locked up, for instance)
- Investigators can make an educated guess that these are cult symbols

##### The cultist's car

- Lt. Poole looking into it, no luck yet
- The car is no longer a lead, but if they visit Erica Carlyle it'll
  try to run them off the road into the snow

##### The Cult of the Bloody Tongue

- Nothing they can learn directly, though going around Harlem asking
  about the cult will result in a lot of people watching them

##### M. Warren Besart / Faraz Najjar

- Nothing further to learn outside of Egypt
- If Erica is questioned she says Roger used to exchange letters with
  people all over the world; most of them trying to get his money

##### The Penhew Foundation

- Nothing specific to learn other than its reputation

##### Arthur Emerson / Emerson Imports

- He has nothing further to contribute

##### Silas N'Kwane / Ju-Ju House

- Questioning Silas won't reveal anything new
- There will always be cultists in or near the shop when the
  investigators are there, unless they shake off the tail
- Questioning the locals will reveal that sometimes at night a great
  many people go into the shop, usually once a month, sometimes more
  **(p154)**
- Watching the shop at day will reveal the bribery, Silas's routine,
  and Mukunga M'Dari (the last not notable unless they watch for long
  enough to see his repeated visits, or if they've heard Hilton
  Adams's description) **(p155)**
- Watching the shop at night will reveal people arriving for the
  rituals **(p155)**

##### Miriam Atwright / Harvard University Library

- She can reveal the book Jackson wanted **(p136)**

##### Prof Cowles / Arkham University / The Cult of Darkness

- He never met Jackson, but read some of his books, and doesn't know
  if he came to his lecture
- If suitably flattered he'll invite the investigators to Arkham (2.5
  hours on train) to see his slides and get a lecture summary
- He can post copies if the investigators absolutely can't travel

##### Lt. Martin Poole

- He has nothing further to contribute (other than pointing them to
  Dr. Lemming).

##### Previous murders

- Lt. Poole or Rebecca Shosenburg can point them to Dr. Mordecai
  Lemming **(p135)**
- Rebecca Shosenburg will approach the investigators about this at the
  funeral **(p145)**

##### Life as a God

- This is hidden in the Carlyle mansion's library **(p134)**

#### Mukunga M'Dari's tail

- There are 4 different cultists watching the investigators in shifts,
  3 black and 1 white
- They will flee if spotted, leading to a chase
- Currently they are just watching: M'Dari wants to know how much the
  investigators know and if Jackson has told anyone else what he knew
- After (at least) 3 days he'll be satisfied it's just the
  investigators and will make a move

#### The funeral

- **(p127)**
- A few reporters keeping a distance, Jonah Kensington, Carlton
  Ramsey, and Willa Sligh in attendance.
- At the end reporters come to ask questions, Rebecca Shosenburg
  pushes to the front and asks if they know anything about the
  connection between Jackson's murder and the previous murders for
  which Hilton Adams was convicted and placed on death row?  If they
  talk to her, she'll invite them to meet at the newspaper's offices.
- Both Carlton Ramsey **(p127)** and Jonah Kensington **(p128)** make
  appointments to see the investigators over the next 48 hours.
- At the reading of the will, Carlton Ramsey says that the bulk of
  Jackson's funds come from "investments made with the proceeds of
  some sort of expedition down in Peru several years back".

### Notes

- Agreed to keep Rebecca Shosenburg in the loop in exchange for an
  introduction to Millie Adams.
- Learned that Erica Carlyle can be contacted through Bradley Grey.
- Sent a telegram to the Penhew Foundation asking if they knew
  anything about Jackson Elias.

  - China (Nairobi Notes)
- Nothing further to learn from Carlton or Jonah, they've shared all
  they have

#### Contact spells

##### The Winged Ones - Contact Elder Thing

Won't work unless in southern Australia (and even then only with a
hard Luck roll).  It will be obvious to the caster that it didn't
work.

##### The Observers - Contact Yithian

The caster will get a sense that it worked.  A few nights later a man
will arrive and ask to speak to whoever cast it, saying he has been
contacted.  He will answer (some of) the gang's questions, if they
agree to go to Australia and free his trapped companion.  His motive
is to get Kakakatak freed and will lie or withold information to avoid
scaring off the investigators.

#### Selections de Livre D'Ivon spells

The Yithian can translate these spells.

- Contact Deity (Nodens) - he is an enemy of Nyarlathotep, and so may
  aid the gang.  He avoids direct confrontation, but can impart
  authority over the Nightgaunts.

- Contact Deity (Tsathoggua) - hew as once worshipped by a great cult
  in prehistoric times, and taught many human wizards.  But he spends
  all his time sleeping or eating, if summoned he can be tempted with
  magically potent food (like, say, another wizard) and onyl after
  eating will he impart any knowledge.

- Create Mist of R'lyeh

If asked about the inverted ankh, "it is one of the symbols of
Nyarlathotep, the enemy of Nodens."

#### Mukunga M'Dari's tail

##### Attack!

- Snowy and dark drive back through the countryside to New York
- A red 1915 Hudson will appear behind the gang and rapidly close on
  them, trying to ram them off the road
- Four men in the car, one being who Kints chased from Jackson's hotel
  room
- The men have Bloody Tongue headbands and have guns and knives
- All will die (or bite off their own tongue) rather than spill the
  beans

##### Captain Robson (Harlem only)

- If a riot starts, Captain Robson's men will take the investigators
  away and encourage them to leave Harlem for good
- If the investigators start loitering outside the Ju-Ju House and
  haven't shaken off the tail, Captain Robson's men will come take the
  investigators away for mopery

#### The Penhew Foundation's response

> ELIAS VISITED 14TH NOV ABOUT CARLYLE EXP. DISCUSSED FUNDING SHORT
> MEETING NO FURTHER INFO

    will be enacted with "our brothers around the world" "in a year's
    time" "on the day of the eclipse"

### Things to bring up next session

- Mukunga M'Dari will find out Cassie was there and send some police
  goons to accuse them of trespass

MoN America session 5, 2020-12-27
---------------------------------

<span class="highlight">I decided to skip this session and go straight to Australia.</span>

**Start:** morning of Monday the 26th of January.  The ritual was last night.

### Recap

Who wants to give it?

### Prep

#### Nodens

- He will only respond to a call in a remote place next to the ocean

#### The Yithian

- Calling will make one appear in a few days time, who asks to speak
  to Rachel Summers (by name).

- He will agree to answer some of the gang's questions if they agree
  to go to Australia and free his trapped companion.

- If questioned he says there are rules preventing his direct
  interference in historic events, but since humanity is going to go
  extinct soon anyway he's inclined to bend that rule.

- He will give the skill **Knowledge of the Future of the Universe**
  at 10%.  Cannot be pushed, cannot have Luck spent on it, cannot be
  improved.  The wielder of the skill will recognise the expedition
  principals on sight.

#### Hallucinations for Cassie

- "Hearing" screams or drumming
- "Recognising" people on the street as having attended the ritual, or
  having had their face on the chakota
- "Seeing" the ciimba out of the corner of her eye, or in reflections,
  or shadows

#### The abduction of Millie Adams

If the gang try to contact Millie Adams (directly or through Rebecca
Shosenburg), they can't reach her.

When the gang return from arranging transport to Australia, they'll
find a letter stuffed under their door saying to come to a certain
warehouse that night, enclosed is a photograph of Millie Adams tied to
a chair and looking terrified.

#### The warehouse confrontation

| Name           | DEX | MOV | Initiative |

| Chakota        |  15 |   4 |         14 |

- On the way to the warehouse the gang will find a recently-killed
  security guard
- The warehouse is dimly lit, the big doors open, Millie Adams visible
  inside tied to a chair
- Upon entering the lights come on, the doors slam shut (revealing 6
  cultists---one is the doorman Cassie met before), and Mukunga M'Dari
  comes out onto the balcony, with two ciimba, to say that Cassie has
  seen what was not for her, and that you all now have a choice to
  join or die.
  - **Choosing to join is game over.**
  - Refusing to join causes Mukunga to cast Clutch of Nyogtha on
    Cassie and the cultists to attack
  - Millie can be freed by reaching her and spending an action
  - If the fight is going badly for the cultists, Mukunga sends in the
    ciimba
  - If the fight is going badly for the ciimba, Mukunga summons the
    chakota which bursts through the floor (**Dodge** (**hard** if in
    melee) to avoid being hit by flying rubble)
  - Sealed exterior doors or windows can be forced open with **STR**
  - Doors on the upper landing lead to rooms with exterior windows
