**This campaign is ongoing and this memo contains spoilers.**


Player characters
-----------------

- **Alton "Dill" Dillinger:** Assistant Secretary for Fish, Wildlife
  and Parks - U.S. Department of the Interior.  Formerly a senator for
  the state of Pennsylvania, he fell from public favour by opposing
  U.S. entry into the First World War.  He did not win re-election.
  Perhaps out of pity, perhaps just trying to get him out of the way,
  political friends of his arranged for him to have a rather
  unimportant and out-of-the-way position.

- **Rachel Summers:** librarian.  A recent high school graduate, who
  was inspired to a love of books by her school's librarian.  Rachel
  is a bit of a bookworm, particularly focussing on nonfiction, with a
  good working knowledge of Latin and biology.

- **Penelope Temple:** librarian / parapsychologist.  A co-worker of
  Rachel's, though she didn't always work in the library.  Penelope
  and her now-deceased husband were once burglars, until one fateful
  job which ended in the foiled robbery of a secret society's
  headquarters and the death (or, at least, disappearance) of her
  husband Percival.

### Notable possessions

- **Penelope's spooky book:** which she stole in the job which claimed
  Percival.  On the surface it appears to be a regular book of fairy
  tales, but they're rather darker and more grim than usual.  The book
  is bound in a type of leather Penelope has not been able to
  identify.

- **Revelations of Gla'aki, vol. 1:** found in Howard's study, beneath
  a false section of flooring.  An encoded telegram with it says it
  was lent to Howard by Dr. Armitage.  One of 9 volumes.

  Describes, in a high level of detail: Gla'aki (along with an
  illustration: a large oval creature rising from a lake and covered
  in spines); its arrival on Earth (trapped in a crystal prison, which
  fell to the Earth and shattered, trapping Gla'aki here until the
  shards can be destroyed); its lifecycle (dormant for centuries,
  wakes up occasionally); the duty of the cult (to grow populous and
  widespread enough to acquire all the shards and to free Gla'aki);
  and their motivation (eternal life, and to ascend to the stars with
  their god).

  Also contains a ritual to contact Gla'aki.

- **Signet ring:** found in a safe in Howard's study.  A silver signet
  ring with a design showing a country house and the full moon.

- **Code book:** found in a safe in Howard's study.  A key to decode
  his telegram exchange with Dr. Armitage.

## Spells

- **Contact Gla'aki:** Penelope can attempt a Hard INT roll to learn
  this once every few days.


Lore
----

### Gla'aki and its cult

Gla'aki is [Loch Morar][], which was created by the impact of the
crystal prison.  The cult is widespread throughout Scotland, extending
as far south as the Yorkshire Dales.

The cult consists solely of undead Servants of Gla'aki, which are
little more than mind-controlled puppets.

The cult has difficulty spreading around the world because Gla'aki
cannot leave the loch, and its fluid and spines drastically lose
potency as soon as they are removed from its body, so creating new
Servants elsewhere is difficult.  Gla'aki can create Avatars even from
this weak fluid, but it takes years for an Avatar to become capable of
creating Servants.

There is an Avatar in [Derwentwater][] in the Lake District and in
[Lough Leane][] in Ireland.  The spines that the gang retrieved from
the Squatter's Lake Motel are inferior spines from a still-growing
Avatar.

Furthermore, in the centuries during which Gla'aki slumbers, it cannot
create new Servants, so the cult inevitably shrinks as Servants pass
away due to accidents.  All of the current Avatars and Servants were
created during Gla'aki's current period of wakefulness, which has
lasted for 90 years.

### Notable NPCs

- **William and Robert Brophy:** Servants of Gla'aki, on the loose
  somewhere in New England with an Avatar of Gla'aki.

- **Howard Carter:** contact from Penelope's criminal days, who poses
  as an author.  Was investigating the spines for Penelope, later
  found dead.  Seems he knows more about this sort of thing than
  Penelope initially suspected.

- **Dr. Clayton Armitage:** contact of Howard's, he knows something
  about the spines and their power.  Leads the "UK branch" of the
  Silver Twilight Lodge, though it's just a country house with a
  handful of other members.

- **Carl Stanford:** leader of the Silver Twilight Lodge.  "Carl" and
  "the Lodge" were mentioned in Howard and Dr. Armitage's telegrams.

### The Silver Twilight Lodge

Founded and lead by Carl Stanford, the STL is a fraternal organisation
based in Boston, Massachusettes, which purports to investigate the
occult and unexplained.  It's not a secret society, though it is a
"society with secrets" and is relatively small and unknown.

Members vary in how much they *know* and how much they *believe*.
Most members have at least some belief in the reality of the occult,
though they know very little.  Carl Stanford and those close to him
more than just believe: they know this stuff to be the truth, and they
have a great deal of knowledge.  Any artefacts and tomes which the STL
gains possession of are only available for extended study by this core
group.

While the STL appears to be a purely investigative organisation, Carl
Stanford and a few of his closest associates are using it to further
the aims of alien gods.

Dr. Armitage is the leader of the UK branch of the Lodge.  He
considers himself a good friend of Carl Stanford, though Carl is
concealing the true purpose of the Lodge from him.  Carl has long ago
realised that having honest people in positions of authority is very
good for maintaining cover, as then if any rumours leak out, they
react with genuine bafflement.

### Questions: Dr. Armitage and Howard Carter

- **Why was Howard killed by a Servant by Dr. Armitage, who has more
  potent spines and has been examining them for longer, has not
  been?**

  Dr. Armitage's country house, where he does his experiments, is
  warded (a simple Elder Sign on every entrance and a more complex one
  in the lab).  This means Gla'aki cannot mentally communicate with
  reanimated creatures inside the house.  It also means Servants
  cannot easily enter, as Gla'aki has destroyed their minds and
  controls them like puppets.

- **Why did Dr. Armitage tell Howard things that would get him killed,
  without also telling him about the wards?**

  Dr. Armitage doesn't know that Gla'aki can track down reanimated
  creatures: he's only ever done it inside his warded house.  The
  Revelations of Gla'aki merely state that "once one has been turned
  to the Great Master, they serve as His eyes and ears", which can
  easily be taken in a metaphorical sense, and that Servants just
  report back.

- **Why did Dr. Armitage send Howard volume 1 of the Revelations of
  Gla'aki?**

  Dr. Armitage knew Howard wouldn't have access to similar texts in
  the US branch of the STL due to his low status.


Session 1, 2020-05-03
---------------------

We played *Servants of the Lake* (in *Doors to Darkness*) as a
one-shot.  Then the players wanted to continue the investigation, so I
had to turn this into a campaign.

I didn't take any notes in the session, but the gist of it is that
they found some zombies, ran away, and returned the next day to find
the motel burned down, everyone and everything gone, and a large trail
leading from the lake (as if something the size of a boat had been
dragged out and into the forest).

The only hard evidence they found were some large metal spines.


Session 2, 2020-05-17
---------------------

### Prep

Penelope sent some of the weird metal spines you found to a discrete
acquaintance, Howard Carter, to have them examined.  Howard sent
frequent, excited, letters: the spines are biological, but don't
correspond to any earthly biology he knows of; when submerged in water
they slowly convert it into a cloudy yellowish fluid; and this fluid,
when injected into lab rats, kills them promptly but, after they are
definitely dead, they undergo violent muscle spasms, sometimes even
jumping and running for minutes.

Then the letters stopped.

Two weeks later, Penelope saw an obituary in the newspaper:

**Handout: Obituary**

> Mr. Howard Carter---of Providence, Rhode Island---was discovered
> dead in his home by the local mailman.  Mr Carter was an author
> known for his fantastical short stories sold to the literary
> magazines.  The coroner has ruled this as a death by natural causes.
> Mr. Carter has no known living relatives so, in accordance with
> state law, if no heir comes forward in the next three months, by
> July 21st, his home and possessions will be auctioned off to the
> highest bidder.

#### The situation

- HC had been corresponding with a Dr. Armitage in England via
  telegram about the spines:
  - Dr. Armitage and HC are both members of the Silver Twilight Lodge:
    a secret international society dedicated to the investigation of
    strange occurrences (Penelope did not know this)
  - These telegrams are in a hidden safe, along with the codebook to
    translate the telegrams, the remaining spines, and a Silver
    Twilight Lodge ring (silver signet ring with a house and full moon
    design).
  - In a rolodex on his desk is a business card for Carl Stanford,
    Purveyor of Antiquities and Rare Books
- Gla'aki spotted what was going on, and where, because of the
  briefly-magically-reanimated rats.
- HC was killed by servants of Gla'aki magically (he drowned while sat
  in his office)
- The coroner just reported natural causes, because what else could he
  say?  Nobody would accept "he drowned, despite being nowhere near a
  body of water, no evidence of water outside the body, and no signs
  of a struggle"
- The house is currently empty.  There are a few reanimated rats
  roaming around inside.

**Handout: Signet Ring**

> A silver signet ring with the design showing a country house and a
> full moon.

#### Dr. Armitage and the telegrams

- Dr. A. had encountered one of these spines before, found in
  Northumberland.  It had the same property of stimulating corpses,
  but far more potent.
- No idea where it came from originally, someone found it in an
  abandoned motel near a lake.
- It's got properties of both organic and inorganic materials, and
  neither seem of this world.
- Since it kills and briefly reanimates anything it's stabbed into,
  best guess is some sort of defence mechanism... but what sort of
  creature would grow spines like this he can't even fathom a guess.

**Handout: Telegrams to Dr. Armitage (summarised, translated)**

> It's a conversation between the two men about the spines.
> Dr. Armitage has seen such things before: he has in his possession
> one found "somewhere in Northumberland, near a lake with an
> abandoned motel".
>
> Dr. Armitage has been investigating the spine for years but without
> much luck: he is the one who suggested Howard look into its chemical
> composition, try putting it in water, and try injecting the fluid
> into small animals.  Your spines and Dr. Armitage's spine seems to
> be the same sort of thing, but his is more potent: the injected mice
> seem to "live" for weeks after their deaths.  He's also successfully
> performed the procedure on cats, dogs, chickens, and one badger.
>
> So far, Dr. Armitagehas been unable to fully analyse the fluid and
> determine what exactly it is doing.  But he suspects that it doesn't
> just cause muscle spasms which imitate life, he believes that it is
> actually reanimating the dead animals.  This is apparently fairly
> clear to see when you have weeks to study a single specimen.
>
> Occasionally they mention a "Carl" and "the Lodge", it seems that
> they're referring to sharing information with this Carl.

#### Carl Stanford and the Silver Twilight Lodge

- Carl will acknowledge HC as an occasional customer (holding
  something back)
- If shown the ring, he will tell about the Silver Twilight Lodge,
  describing it as an international society of ghost hunters and
  occultists - he'll make it sound like kind of a game, rather than an
  ominous secret society
- He knows everything that's happened but won't let on (he has a magic
  mirror with which he can spy on any room that contains a STL ring)
- He can point the investigators to Dr. A
- He'll also offer membership.  Joining is normally invitation-only
  but, since they knew HC and are evidently interested in this sort of
  thing... Membership is $1/mo, the conditions are to keep the society
  secret and to share any information they encounter, in retun Carl
  will pass on gossip to them.
- Secretly, the STL has some of the spines and are trying to figure
  out how to control the zombies they create.  But the investigators
  have no way to discover that.

#### Investigating the murder

The mailman:

1. Neighbours can give his name and address: Mr. James Feist lives in
   a small house a few streets away with his wife and daughter.
2. He'll tell the investigators his story if they inform him they're
   friends of Mr. Carter.

**Mr. Feist's Tale**

> I liked Mr. 'oward, 'e'd often stop and chat wi' me when I came
> 'round.  'E always 'ad parcels and letters coming from 'round the
> world: research for 'is stories 'e said.
>
> Well one day I shows up with a parcel, and 'e 'adn't collected the
> last lot from 'is doorstep yet.  There were bottles of milk
> untouched too.  "Well that's a mite queer" I thought, "Mr 'oward
> ain't the sort of man to forget to cancel 'is deliveries when 'e
> goes away."  So I got a bit worried like.
>
> I pounded on that door of 'is, but 'e didn't answer.  I went 'round
> the 'ouse lookin' in the windows, and there 'e was!  All laid out on
> the floor.  I shouted 'is name and knocked some more, but 'e didn't
> move.  I ran to Mrs. Maple's 'ouse and told 'er to ring for a
> doctor, and I went back to Mr 'oward, smashed the window, and 'opped
> inside.  'E was cold, I'm no medical man, but I could tell it was
> too late.  So I just sits there until the police and the doctor show
> up, and take 'im away.
>
> 'E was a good man, I'll be sad to see 'im gone.

The coroner:

1. Police / hospital / newspaper can give the name of the coroner who
   determined the cause of death (Mr. James Sutton)
2. The coroner hasn't gone to work for a few days
3. The coroner's address can be found in the office records - but the
   staff won't just give it away to a random member of the public
4. The coroner is at home, very drunk, and has been drunk for days:
   he's been trying to forget what he saw.

**Mr. Sutton's Tale**

> Mr. Carter... he's why I'm in this state.  Trying to forget, you
> see.  In my profession, you see a lot of horrible things.  Not
> everyone dies peacefully in their sleep.  Injury, murder, even
> disease can leave horrifying marks on the body which we coroners
> must soon become comfortable with.  It is not a trade for squeamish
> men.
>
> Nevertheless, here I am.  Trying to forget.
>
> I left my report suitably vague, merely saying that the cause of
> death is not suspicious, and that is the truth, in a sense.  The
> manner of Mr. Carter's death is perfectly common, and could happen
> to me or to you, if we are so unfortunate.  You see, he drowned.
> And it appears he drowned in freshwater: for when I cut into his
> bloated lungs, out poured the water, some small fragments of
> freshwater plants, even a tadpole.
>
> But answer me this: how could a man drown, on dry land, miles away
> from a large body of water, with no other signs of being submerged?
> No exterior marks, no traces of the same water in his stomach or
> mouth, not even a wrinkling of the fingertips!  No signs that the
> body had been moved after death, and no signs of a break-in to his
> house. It is utterly impossible that he could have filled his lungs
> with water, returned home, locked his door, and only then
> succumbed... I cannot explain it, and it scares me.

### Notes

The players did almost nothing in my prep, and spent almost the whole
session in the house, before deciding to immediately travel to England
and talk to Dr. Armitage in person.

Well, plot never survives contact with players...  they enjoyed it, at
least.

- Players go to the house:
  - They check the front door: it's locked
  - They walk around the building, and find the smashed window
    (covered in a tarp):
    - See it was broken from the outside
    - Look around for neighbours (neighbour house looks occupied, but
      nobody visible currently)
  - Rachel clambers into the study
  - She goes to find the back door (in the kitchen): it's locked
    - Finds key rack
    - Unlocks back door and lets the others in
  - All proceed to study to examine it:
    - Dill tries to figure out if the tarp was there before or after
      the murder (did someone break in and kill him?), but there's not
      enough information to tell
    - Desk is covered in books about biology and folklore:
      - One book about germ theory looks particularly well-used
      - The folklore books are all about the living dead: vampires,
        zombies, kharisiri, etc
      - Inside one book is a slip of paper with 7 numbers written on
        it
    - Behind a painting on the wall is a safe:
      - The code is the 7 numbers
      - Inside the safe is the signet ring, the code book, and the
        encoded telegrams
  - Dill and Penelope head upstairs
    - Rachel stays in the study to work on decoding the telegrams
    - Penelope has been here before, so she knows the layout
    - Nothing particularly exciting, but there is a big bundle of cash
      (enough to survive on for a few weeks at least) beneath the
      mattress of the master bedroom
    - There are rats in the walls, everywhere
  - Dill heads into the attic with a candle and a lighter
    - Rat shadows dart out of sight
    - Lots of boxes of dusty books, mostly nonfiction
  - The sun is starting to set
  - Rachel translated enough to know the telegrams are talking about
    the spines
  - Everyone goes to check out the basement:
    - Dill goes down first, ends in a wooden door and a light switch
    - Opens door, flips on light
    - Lots of rats in cages, aggressive, squeaking
    - One cage empty, has been gnawed through
    - Wooden workbench with the spines and a jar of yellow fluid
    - Rachel examines the rats: they've all got big tab wounds---the
      size of the spines---and should barely be moving, let alone
      aggressively jumping around
  - Everyone decides the house is infested with zombie rats, and has
    to be burned down
    - Spend the next few hours searching
    - Find Revelations of Gla'aki beneath study floor
    - Fill basement with dusty books from attic
    - Douse basement, stairs, and ground floor in lamp oil
    - Carry everything off to the car (including some nice silverware
      to fence)
    - Dill drops a match on the lamp oil, drives off as the house
      starts to burn
    - The house doesn't explode, thankfully; the neighbours will
      notice, but not immediately
- Everyone wonders if Howard got infected with a zombie virus by the
  escaped rats
- A few days later:
  - Penelope rings the newspaper, asking for details about Howard,
    posing (truthfully!) as a friend of his:
    - Get funeral details (a few days time)
    - Get contact details for the Providence coroner
  - Rachel shares the translated telegrams
- At the funeral:
  - Arrive early
  - Penelope thoroughly distracts the priest and one other attendee
    with a discussion about the nature of religion and the religion of
    nature
  - Dill lifts up coffin lid
  - Rachel examines body: Howard seems pretty dead, no obvious wounds
- Afterwards:
  - Telegram Dr. Armitage about meeting
  - Hop into a boat
  - Penelope spends the crossing studying the book

### Next session

In England meeting Dr. Armitage.


Session 3, 2020-05-31
---------------------

### Prep

It's a beautiful summer day in London, it's early June, and you
arrived two days ago.  You've taken lodgings in a bed & breakfast in
the borough of Lewisham, just south of the Thames.  The city is huge,
with over 7 million people, it's the largest in the world currently.
And it is in this vast metropolis that Dr. Armitage has proposed you
meet.

In his reply to your telegram, he said that he would be conducting
some business with colleagues at the University of London, the British
Library, and the British Museum.  Something about Egyptian mummies, he
wasn't too specific.  And he has proposed a meeting at the Penhew
Foundation, an archeological institute, for 3 o'clock Thursday
afternoon, which is four days from now.

You've got some time to kill; you could spend it in your rooms, try to
do some research, or anything you want.  What do you want to do?

#### Killing time in London

- No mysteries planned
- Have a pickpocket chase at some point
- If they're out at night emphasise the fogs

#### The Penhew Foundation

- Info:
  - Impressive Victorian-style building in Central London, much
    grander than the buildings on either side.
  - Established in 1890 by Sir Aubrey Penhew, a renowned Egyptologist.
  - Sir Aubrey disappeared last year on an expedition, but he and the
    rest of the expedition members were recently confirmed to have
    been attacked and killed by hostile tribesmen in the African
    jungle.
  - Edward Gavigan is now the director
  - "Surely you heard of the Carlyle Massacre, it was all over the news!"
- Meeting Dr. Armitage:
  - Asking at the front desk leads the investigators to the small
    office he is temporarily using.
  - It's empty.
  - After a moment, hear two voices through a different door, door
    opens, Dr. Armitage emerges, saying "thank you, as always, for
    your support Edward; it is a pleasure working with the
    Foundation."
  - He starts, and realises that he's a little late, and who they are,
    and greets them, ushering them into his office.
- Talking to Dr. Armitage:
  - He's interested in how they got the spines (you were light on
    details with Howard).
  - And in Howard's death.
  - And in Howard's experiments.
  - And definitely in getting his book back!
  - He'll also mistake the group for a married couple and their
    daughter!
  - Ask for a **Cthulhu Mythos** roll to impress him.
  - If he's impressed, he'll be more open about the STL, otherwise
    he'll deflect it as "a fraternal organisation for those of us who
    are interested in knowledge".
  - In any case, he'll propose they go to his country estate to look
    at the other books in the set and his investigation materials.

#### Lathom House

- A large country house in Lancashire, bought by Dr. Armitage just
  before the war, when the Earl of Lathom was ruined by his gambling
  debts.
- It's a place with a lot of history: there was a wooden castle on the
  site in the 1300s, it was rebuilt as a stone castle some time in the
  1500s, but now almost all trace of that is gone, only a few bits of
  ruined wall and tower in the grounds remain, it's just a very large
  country house.
- Probably haunted.
- Dry stone wall around the buildings, with metal gates; carved into
  the walls at the gates are Elder Signs (**Spot Hidden** to notice).
- Situated a 2-hour drive from Wigan, which is a 4-hour train journey
  from London.
- Two servants: an elderly housekeeper (Mrs. Covenant) and a gardener
  / handyman (Mr. Donaldson).
- One STL member is staying: Ned Thistlewaite

#### Contacting Gla'aki

- Dr. Armitage thinks contacting Gla'aki is crazy talk but will teach
  Penelope the Elder Sign if she insists on trying it.
- If Penelope learns the ritual, she can perform it
- Nothing seems to happen
- That night she enters a sunken crystal city in her dreams, feels
  drawn towards the centre, there's a deep pit, a feeling of dread...
- If she looks in the pit, Gla'aki rises: **SAN** roll, she knows what
  Gla'aki wants (freedom) and why it can't just leave (crystal
  fragments)
- Before looking in the pit, can escape with the Elder Sign.

#### The Dark Young

- Ned is examining an artefact he had sent from Alaska: a black stone
  with cuneiform scratched into it, with a black,twisted, and thorny
  wooden branch sticking out of the top.  He'll unwittingly release a
  Dark Young in the middle of the night.
- The DY won't be able to cross the border because of the Elder Signs.
- Dr. Armitage will realise that the Elder Signs protected him from
  Gla'aki, and that's why Howard died: he'll blame himself.
- Penelope won't wake up while she's in the dream.
