## Work

- I've done a lot of support these past couple of weeks: I was on call
  from Wednesday the 21st to Wednesday the 28th, then doing in-hours
  support from Wednesday the 28th to Wednesday the 4th, next week.  I
  also covered someone's in-hours shift on Friday the 23rd (which is
  also the only day so far I've been called, so it's not so bad).

  But, for future sanity, maybe avoid doing adjacent on-call and
  in-hours shifts, with on-call involving a long weekend, and covering
  someone else's in-hours day before the long weekend.

  I've not really got much done other than that.

## Miscellaneous

- I played a bunch of Minecraft for the first time in months at the
  beginning of the week, but I rapidly reached the point at which I
  become bored every time: after setting up a base (which takes
  several hours to make a good one), everything else is just a matter
  of time, there's not really much challenge left in the game.

  I think the game I actually want is not Minecraft, but something
  which starts out like Minecraft (or Stardew Valley, any
  "managing-a-single-base-yourself" style game really), which gives
  you mechanics to hire workers and smoothly transitions into a
  village/city sim.  However, village/city sim games have the same
  problem, but on a larger scale.  Eventually your city becomes
  basically perfect and there's no more challenge.  So ideally you'd
  then have some sort of smooth transition into national politics,
  then international politics.  I'm not sure what would come after
  that.

- I picked up [Rise to Ruins][], currently on sale on Steam, as a
  combination tower defence / village sim / god game.  I like all of
  those genres independently (putting aside the issue of village sims
  becoming super boring in the end-game), so hopefully I'll like this.
  I've played a couple of short games now, and had my village taken
  out by monsters in a couple of game-days both times, so it has some
  challenge to it.

- I updated my [Personal Finance][] memo, which made me notice a
  fairly large shift in my financial habits which I'd not really
  thought about before.  I used to make use of forecasting *really
  heavily*, I'd even go so far as to say that forecasting was almost
  the entire reason I tracked my finances.  But now I barely forecast
  at all.  I suppose this marks the shift from being a poor Ph.D
  student to having a stable and well-paying job, with no significant
  financial concerns.
