## Work

I was on support from Wednesday, which I forgot about until Tuesday,
so I didn't get as much team-related work done as I'd planned.  But I
at least managed to finish off some things.

So far on support I've spent all my time trying to debug an issue in a
legacy thing we have which is written in a language nobody really
knows (Scala), is very old and crufty (it's been around since 2012),
has development outsourced to another company (who only make a couple
of changes a year), and we generally don't have much knowledge of what
it does or how it works.  All the people who did know these things
left years ago.

So it's been a bit of a challenge, but I think I see the light at the
end of the tunnel.


## Books

This week I read:

- [Izirion's Enchiridion of the West Marches][] by Dom Liotti and Sam Sorensen.

  I kickstarted this a little while ago, and received my physical copy
  a few months back.  I'm planning to write a more in-depth review on
  [my RPG blog][], but generally I liked it.  There's lots of random
  tables, rules, and guidance; but it's all pretty modular, so you can
  pick up the bits you want for your game and leave the rest.  It also
  has fully-worked examples in an appendix, and some guidelines for
  how to use this book (which is written for D&D 5e) with a more OSR
  system.

  My main criticism of it is that the text is *tiny*.

## Gaming

I've been reading [The Monsters Know What They're Doing][] this week,
which has some really great analyses of monster combat tactics.

Whilst all the worked examples are for D&D and, so, not really
portable to other systems---the blog takes the position that any
creatures which have evolved in a world run by D&D mechanics have an
instinctive understanding of those mechanics, and so pick their
tactics accordingly---I think the [Why These Tactics?][] page is
pretty portable: the exact numbers and attributes will need tweaking,
but the ideas are sound.

I'm going to have a go at analysing some of the Call of Cthulhu
monsters I'm likely to throw at my players in the next few sessions,
and see if I can come up with some more interesting combats than the
usual "a horrifying beast appears before you, and tries to rip you in
half".
