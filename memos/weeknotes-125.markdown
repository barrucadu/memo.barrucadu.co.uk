## Work

I spent a lot of time this week on [the RFC][], shepherding it through
the review process by responding to comments and making amendments.  I
think it's in a good state now, but there's just one remaining issue
about how exactly the auth flow will work, so I've had to extend the
deadline for discussion to mid next week.

Not ideal, but perhaps better than implementing something and
immediately discovering it's flawed.  At some point a decision needs
to be made though, even if we then revisit it in the future.

## Books

This week I read:

- [Dust of Dreams][] by Steven Erikson, the ninth of the [Malazan Book of the Fallen][].

  The penultimate book.  It focuses on the situation in Lether (the
  continent, not the empire): the Bonehunters, the Perish Grey Helms,
  the Khundryl Burned Tears, and the Barghast.  We get some more of
  the schemes of the Elder Gods, the flight of the Shake, and the
  plans of the K'Chain Che'malle.  We also get a new group of
  characters: the "Snake", a group of children fleeing the "Quitters"
  across a vast desert.

  Steven Erikson's introductory note describes the book as "the first
  half of a two volume novel," so when I finished it I moved straight
  onto [The Crippled God][].

## Gaming

It looks like the time is nigh for my Call of Cthulhu group to flee
Australia, probably to England, so I've been thinking about a short
adventure to run in the space between chapters.

I'm thinking of trying out [Troika][], and I gave them this pitch:

> Your patron has sent you to a distant world, inhabited by a mighty
> magician none have seen for centuries (and so is presumed
> long-dead), to retrieve a priceless artefact from the magician's
> mansion.  But there will be magical booby traps, who-knows-what
> spells, and possibly even enslaved demons, in your way.

I've got a few ideas, and I think it'll be a fun one.

I also bought a few new RPG books this week, which should be arriving
later in the month.

## Miscellaneous

I got an [Awair Element][] to monitor [the quality of my air][], and
[wrote a memo about it][].

## Link Roundup

I read a lot of different things, so I'm experimenting with breaking
this section up by genre.  As always, the links here, and from
previous weeknotes, and even from beyond, are collected in [my
bookmarks browser][].
