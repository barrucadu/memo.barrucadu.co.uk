This memo lists campaigns I'd be interested in running.  Each idea is
ranked against three axes:

- **Politics:** how much will you get involved with different
  factions, which scheme and have non-obvious goals and motivations?

- **Roleplaying:** how important is, and how often will you be,
  interacting and negotiating with NPCs?

- **Self Direction:** how much does the campaign rely on you
  developing your own goals?

I also list published campaigns here.  They're a bit different in that
they're inherently less flexible than something I'm entirely making
up, but that doesn't mean they're totally inflexible and that player
agency is an illusion.


## Call of Cthulhu / Pulp Cthulhu

### Masks of Nyarlathotep

<aside class="highlight">This is a published nonlinear campaign for Call of Cthulhu / Pulp Cthulhu.</aside>

Your good friend Jackson Elias, an author who infiltrates and writes
about cults, contacts you out of the blue in a panic.  He says he's
found signs of something big, some sort of conspiracy, but he won't go
into details over a channel which could be tapped.  He can't do this
alone and needs a reliable team to help him.  He sets a meeting: New
York, January 15th, 1925.

You arrive, but are too late.  Jackson is dead, freshly murdered.  A
strange symbol carved into his forehead, a symbol seen in a series of
other murders.  There's more here than meets the eye, you don't know
what's going on, but you do know that Jackson found something.  And
now he's dead.

- **Politics:** Low
- **Roleplaying:** Medium
- **Self Direction:** Low

**Player buy-in:** The player characters have to be motivated to solve
the mystery their friend left behind, even at risk of their own lives
and sanity.  This is a nonlinear campaign which has several major
parts with clues pointing between them, and which can be visited in
any order: but it's not static, your actions in any one part of the
campaign will have ramifications in other parts.  This is a long and
detailed campaign, you will have to keep careful notes of clues and
discoveries, or you just won't know what's going on, and you can
expect it to last somewhere between 1 and 2 years.

### The Two-Headed Serpent

<aside class="highlight">
This is a published campaign for Pulp Cthulhu.  I've only skimmed
through the book so far, so I can't fully describe it here.  It sounds
pretty linear, but with some scope for doing parts of it in different
orders, and is a mixture of assigned missions and independent
investigation.
</aside>

The year is 1933.  In South America, the Chaco War between Bolivia and
Paraguay is in full swing.  You've been employed by a humanitarian
charity, the Caduceus Foundation, to deliver medical aid to civilians
caught up in the war.  Caduceus has flown you to Asuncion in Paraguay,
from where you travelled across country, escorting doctors, nurses,
and medical supplies to an aid camp deep in the jungle of Gran Chaco.

The truth, which the player characters don't know at the start, but
which their team leader will fill them in on, is that the Caduceus
Foundation is a front for an organisation which battles the Cthulhu
Mythos.  For now, the player characters are just heroes who have
volunteered to help a humanitarian charity, but soon they will be
pulled into combatting the mythos.

- **Politics:** ?
- **Roleplaying:** ?
- **Self Direction:** ?

**Player buy-in:** The player characters are a heroic bunch who
volunteered to help civilians caught in a war, but don't bat an eye
when it turns out the organisation they joined is actually fighting
more than just humans.


## OSR

### Veinscrawl

The dwarves tunneled into a vast chasm leading deep, deep, down, into
a realm which has never seen the light of the sun, and is home to
strange peoples and monsters.

Now, months later, a bustling town of adventurers and profiteers has
formed along its side.  Some trading with the inhabitants, others
sending out parties in search of treasure.  It's a new gold rush, who
knows what this strange underworld will bring?

- **Politics:** Low
- **Roleplaying:** Low
- **Self Direction:** High

**Player buy-in:** The player characters are adventurers from the
surface who now live in the town, making their living by heading out,
exploring, finding new things, and returning triumphant.  They are
self-directed, interested in exploring for the sake of exploring, and
motivated by treasure and discovery.


## Traveller

### The Traveller Campaign

A sandbox campaign set in the standard Traveller setting.  This will
probably be in a border region like the Spinward Marches or the Trojan
Reach just because I think being set entirely within one of the vast
space empires reduces the scope for small-scale interstellar politics:
it's either big-scale dukes-plotting-against-the-emperor kind of thing
or power-tripping planetary governments, with nothing in between.

You will have a ship and a mortgage to pay off, or maybe a free ship
from someone you owe favours to, and will need to do whatever it takes
to meet those obligations.  Carrying freight and passengers is easy
but kind of dull, seeking out patrons to undertake missions for pay
can be better but also risky.  You'll occasionally unintentionally
stumble into trouble or adventure.  You can follow rumours to find
wealth, or maybe just disaster.

- **Politics:** ?
- **Roleplaying:** ?
- **Self Direction:** High

**Player buy-in:** This is essentially a job- or planet-of-the-week /
"do what you want" campaign: I'll prepare interesting locations,
people, rumours, and opportunities, and you engage with whatever seems
fun.  This campaign can easily transform into a more focussed one if
we want.

### To Boldly Go

It's the year 2090AD, the planets of the solar system have long-since
been settled and exploited, and are governed by the Planetary
Consortium based on Earth, which is essentially a puppet government
run by the megacorps.

Everything changed a few years ago, with the invention of the Jump
Drive, allowing ships to travel an entire parsec in a mere week.  The
Planetary Consortium saw this as the solution to the ongoing
population crisis and lack of resources, and started constructing and
loaning out jump-capable starships to competent crews, funding
exploration, prospecting, and research.

Now, there are a few permanent colonies in the closest suitable
systems.  Further out, there are exploration hubs staffed by
semi-permanent crews of outcasts, consortium officials, and explorers.
Exploration is dangerous and proceeds slowly, at the cost of many
lives.  Lucky crews have found bizarre alien creatures, they've found
resource-rich worlds which one day will be exploited, they've found
suitable sites for new colonies, and some have even found artefacts
and ruins from ancient civilisations.  Nobody has found a living
intelligent alien species yet, but First Contact is the dream of every
explorer.

- **Politics:** Low
- **Roleplaying:** Medium
- **Self Direction:** High

**Player buy-in:** The player characters are brave (or perhaps just
foolhardy) space adventurers.  They risk death every time they jump
into uncharted space, and are motivated by the thrill of the unknown.

### The Pirates of Drinax

<aside class="highlight">This is a published sandbox campaign for Traveller.</aside>

Drinax, once a mighty interstellar kingdom but now a bombed-out
radioactive husk of a world, lies along two major trade routes and is
close to two of the most significant interstellar empires in all of
Charted Space: the Aslan Hierate and the Third Imperium.

The current king has an idea to recover some of Drinax's lost glory.
He needs a band of privateers and agents, who can curry favour with
worlds once part of the kingdom, and also cause trouble along the
trade routes between the Hierate, the Imperium, and the (much smaller)
Florian League.  No empire is willing to allow another to establish a
large permanent military force close to their borders, but they may be
willing to delegate the job of policing the space lanes to a
newly-reformed kingdom which they could easily squash if it starts
trouble.

The king's plan is to bring the old worlds of the kingdom back under
the banner of Drinax, stir up piracy in the region enough that the
empires agree something needs to be done, and then use that to get
their blessing for a new interstellar state.  Of course, if they learn
too soon that *Drinax* is behind the upsurge in piracy, it'll all fall
apart...

- **Politics:** High
- **Roleplaying:** High
- **Self Direction:** Medium

**Player buy-in:** The player characters have two very different
roles: negotiators and space pirates.  Both of those have to sound
fun.  You will be able to (and are encouraged to!) hire other pirates
and so could delegate that side of the campaign entirely to others,
but it will take a while to get the resources (ships, funds, and crew)
to do that.  Furthermore, this is a sandbox-style campaign: there are
several adventures, but player characters are expected to go above and
beyond just those, and will need to think about how to curry favour
with factions and cause trouble on the trade routes themselves.
