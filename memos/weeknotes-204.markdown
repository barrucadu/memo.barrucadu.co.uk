## Books

No books this week.


## Roleplaying Games

This week I ran a couple of one-shots: Winter's Daughter for Old
School Essentials, and The Haunting for Call of Cthulhu.

I've run Winter's Daughter a few times now, so that was easy to run
with no prep (and went well, other than one character dying the
instant they set foot in the dungeon due to an animated crucifix
embedding itself in their skull), but I'd not run (or even read) The
Haunting before.

But it's a very simple scenario, and well laid out in the special
edition 40th anniversary Keeper's Guide, so I was able to not only run
it, but also convert it on the fly to a modern day setting after a
single quick read-through, I see why it's the standard introductory
scenario.

All went well, it was a lot of fun, and things never go how you
expect---even after running the scenario several times previously.


## Miscellaneous

This week I was visiting family: my dad and his partner of several
years got married.  So I took Wednesday through Friday off work, and
spent that back in Hull staying over at my brother's place.

It was nice, although incredibly hot, and the AC was broken in both
trains for my 3 hour journey home today...
