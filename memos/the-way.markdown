On Attitude
-----------

1. **Take it easy**

    Actively relax, and try not to become stressed about things. If things are going poorly, ask
    yourself what the consequences will be in five years or a decade. Probably none.

2. **The time is what it is**

    Live in the moment, and worry less about the future. More practically, stop checking a watch if
    you have allowed enough time for whatever it is you need to do.

3. **Some things are in our control and others not**
   <cite>The Enchiridion, Epictetus</cite>

    Not everything will go well in life, and sometimes bad things will seem to come out of
    nowhere. When that happens, ask yourself if you could have affected or foreseen the outcome: if
    not, don't worry about it, just deal with it.


On People
---------

1. **One time, one meeting (一期一会, ichi-go ichi-e)**
   <cite>Japanese idiom</cite>

    Treasure meetings and gatherings, as they will never be repeated exactly. Even if the same
    people are gathered in the same situation, the attitudes of the people will have changed over
    time.


On Techniques
-------------

1. **There is no single recipe for making the perfect tea, as there are no rules for producing a
   Titian or a Sesson**
   <cite>The Book of Tea, Kakuzo Okakura</cite>

    There is no guaranteed path to perfection. All rules are mutable. Things are not universally
    good or bad. "Only a Sith deals in absolutes" is another a way of expressing the latter part of
    this.

2. **A standard is the least unsatisfactory, not the best**

    Just because something is the standard or established way of doing things does not make it
    superior to newer alternatives. Question tradition.
