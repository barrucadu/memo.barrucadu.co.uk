Overview
--------

### Pitch

> You are a group of cartographers from the imperial capital Endon, far off to
> the south east, appointed by Royal Decree to come to the backwater,
> out-of-the-way, and downright weird Duchy of Brackenwold, to comprehensively
> map out the Dolmenwood, something the local rulers have somehow never managed.
> And speaking of those local rulers, they’re not quite sure how to act with you
> noble folk hanging around.  The Duchy was once a kingdom in its own right, and
> has been largely left to its own devices since being annexed by the Empire
> some 600 years ago.  In principle everyone here is honour-bound to help you
> out as best they can but, well, Endon is far away and you might not find them
> as cooperative as they could be.
>
> There are strange stories about the Dolmenwood, some folk say there’s all
> manner of weird fairy creatures living beneath its tangled branches; that it
> was once ruled by a fearsome frost elf known as the Cold Prince, who hungers
> to reclaim his mortal territory once more; and that it’s now threatened by
> some sort of chaos being from the unclaimed northlands.  These rural folk, I
> tell you...

### Game Log

- **Session 0.** Discussed what sort of campaign we wanted, created characters.
  Characters entered Dolmenwood through the Wenchgate, get robbed by the bakers.

- **Session 1: Mr Rag-and-bone.** Heard about Drune in the woods to the
  north-east, and about Violet Harrowmoor taken by bandits to the Abbey of St
  Clewyd.  Visit the abbey, see the kids, get driven away by Mr
  Rag-and-bone---but not before Maybelle is inflicted with death-rot!

- **Session 2: Knobbled Mandrake.** Learn that death-rot can be cured with
  knobbled mandrake.  Send word to Harrowmoor Keep about young Violet and head
  into the woods.  A wounded elf: more tales of Drune.  Meet Azeria and find the
  knobbled mandrake.  Return to Prigwort, get Maybelle cured, and hear that Lady
  Harrowmoor has a reward waiting.  Finally, get Mostlemyre Drouge's "help
  wanted" notice.

- **Session 3: Stupid Sexist Trees.** Meet Mostlemyre Drouge and get the quest.
  Explore the hexes around Prigwort.  Go loot Mr Rag-and-bone's tower, cleared
  by the Harrowmoor knights.

- **Session 4: Gorthstone.** Investigate the rumour of Drune to the north east:
  find the Gorthstone, meet the phantom, and get driven away by two Drune.
  Collect reward from Harrormoow Keep, and see Lord Malbleat leaving in a huff.
  Meet Arfred's tutor-knight, Sir Abygail Twinsor.  Delve into Sir Chyde's tomb,
  encounter the guardians, decide to leave and do some research.

- **Session 5: Redcaps Eat Horses.** Research Drouge and Sir Chyde.  Arfred
  visits Harrowmoor Keep to get knighted.  Return to Sir Chyde's tomb: save a
  Moss Dwarf from a band of Redcaps, but barely escape with their lives.  Hire
  more retainers: strength in numbers!  Make it to the tomb, and deal with the
  guardians.

- **Session 6: Winter's Daughter.** Do the dungeon: wish for fairy horses from
  Princess Snowfall-at-Dusk.

- **Session 7: Gorthstone, Again.** Tell Drouge what went down at Sir Chyde's
  tomb.  Return to the Gorthstone.  Lillibeth copies down its runes.  Party
  kills a Drune who comes to drive them away.

- **Session 8: The Triple Compact.** Follow the road north-east of Prigwort to
  Odd.  Decline to participate in sprite genocide.  Talk to the sage and learn
  about the Triple Compact.  See the Drune doing something odd in the church at
  night.  Bully Broobe into telling them what's up.

- **Session 9: Fairy Roads.** Find the Willow Gate, and make it to King
  Pusskin's Road with only mild time dilation.  Check out Lankshorn.  Lillibeth
  jumps into the standing stones and is sent to the Isle of Yeth.  See the
  frozen spires of Hoarblight Keep!  Drune capture Lillibeth!

- **Session 10: Lillibeth and the Drune.** *Single-player special!* Lillibeth
  given a quest by the Drune to help convince them that the murder was a big
  misunderstanding.

- **Session 11: Tomb of the Goat Lords.** Reunite with Lillibeth!  Decide to
  kill time until Sir Chyde's sword is identified by exploring.  Find and delve
  into TotSK.

- **Session 12: Tomb of the Goat Lords / Sir Chyde's Sword.** Get chased off by
  a Black Pudding, meet some Barrowbogeys, learn the magic of Sir Chyde's Sword,
  and head out to Castle Brackenwold.

- **Session 13: "Is Everyone In This Wood Evil?"** Do some research into
  Gheillough and discover the Big Chook.  Kidnap Wymond Browne after learning
  he's working for the frost elves (and shoot down his "join me, work under the
  Cold Prince!" spiel).  Then hand him over to a Drune they hear muttering about
  awakening Gheillough---the players think Gheillough and the Big Chook are the
  same entity, cue "is everyone in this wood evil?"  Finally, Paolo and Agnel
  get some cool tattoos.


House Rules

| ----------- | ---------------------------------- | ---- | ------------------ | --------------- |

| Goatfolk    | Dolmenwood Player's Book           | 38   | DEX >= 9           | INT, STR        |

| Minstrel    | Dolmenwood Player's Book           | 46   | INT >= 9           | CHA, DEX        |

Note that **Clerics**, **Illusionists**, and **Magic-Users** belong to
one of the organisations listed on page 51 of the **Dolmenwood
Player's Book**.

Furthermore, **Clerics** and **Friars** all belong to the Church of
the One True God, the state religion of the Empire, of which the local
religious head is the Bishop of Brackenwold.

#### Hit Points

Take the maximum.

#### Alignments

Only **Lawful** or **Neutral**.  No **Chaotic** characters.

#### Known Languages

We're using the languages from the **Dolmenwood Player's Book**.

**Woldish** is the Common of this setting.  Everyone has that for
free.  Then you get a number of additional languages based on your INT
score:

- **Gaffe**, the language of the Shorthorns, the goatfolk commonalty
  of the High Wold.
- **Caprice**, the language of the Longhorns, the goatfolk noblility
  of the High Wold.
- **Sylvan**, the common tongue of the fairies found frequently
  visiting the mortal world.
- Clerics, Friars, and those with connections to the Church may also
  choose **Liturgic**, the holy tongue of scripture and sermon.
- The educated or noble may also choose **Old Woldish**, the historic
  and now-dead original version of Woldish.
- Non-locals may also choose **Imperial Common**, the language of the
  wider empire, not really used around here.

If you want to think in real-world terms, **Old Woldish** is like
Anglo-Saxon, **Imperial Common** like Norman French, and **Woldish**
is Middle English, the bastard offspring of the two.  Knowing
**Woldish** means you'll recognise a few words in the others, but not
enough to communicate.  **Liturgic** is the Latin of this setting.

There are no alignment languages.  Alignment languages are silly.

#### Starting Money & Equipment

Roll for quick-start equipment, as described on page 76 of the
**Dolmenwood Player's Book**.

#### Starting Spells (Illusionist & Magic-User)

Roll N unique numbers on 1d12 (determined by your INT, see page 124 of
the **Advanced Fantasy Player's Tome**) and pick those spells from the
relevant level 1 lists (page 130 for **Illusionists**, page 131 for
**Magic-Users**).

#### Birth Date & Moon Sign

- Roll for the birth date in the Dolmenwood calendar (page 98 of the
  **Dolmenwood Player's Book**): 1d12 and then 1d28, 1d30, or 1d31.
- Check the **Dolmenwood Calendar** to see if this is a feast day.
- Check what moon sign this is (pages 102 & 103 of the **Dolmenwood
  Player's Book**), which confers a minor mechanical benefit.

### Optional rules

This list does not contain referee-facing rules like morale rules,
only the rules which directly affect players.

- **OSE Advanced Fantasy Player's Tome:**
  - Ascending AC
  - Arcane spellcasters can wield staves
  - Advanced spellbook rules
  - Detailed encumbrance
  - Attacking with two weapons
  - Parrying
  - Splash weapons

- **Dolmenwood Player's Book:**
  - Inebriation
  - Smoking
  - Camping

### Hit Die is Damage Die

PCs roll their hit die to determine damage, instead of 1d6.  Damage of melee
attacks is still modified by STR.

### Hit Points

When you level up, take the maximum.

### Shields

If a physical hit takes you to 0HP or less, and you have a shield equipped, then
instead the shield is destroyed and you remain at 1HP.

### XP for Exploration

- Exploring a hex gives 100xp (each) for the first hex, 200xp for the
  second, 300xp for the third (etc), resetting when you return to a
  town.
- Overcoming a hidden thing (intentionally left vague) gives 50xp, on
  top of any other XP gained doing that.

Exploration XP, like gold XP, is gained upon returning to a town.

### XP for Carousing

Once per session in a civilised settlement, a PC may choose to Carouse
to gain additional XP.  A PC who goes carousing must choose to spend a
certain amount of gold, limited by the size of the settlement:

- **Village:** 1d6 * 100 gold spent / XP gained
- **Town:** 1d8 * 150 gold spent / XP gained
- **City:** 1d10 * 200 gold spent / XP gained

In any given settlement, carousers may choose to roll for a smaller
entry.

If the amount of gold spent is more than the PC has, and the party
cannot (or won't) cover it, the PC is now in debt to someone nefarious
and must Save vs Poison or roll for a mishap.

If the die result is higher than the PC's level, they must roll for a
mishap.

#### Mishaps (3d6)

3. **Get in way over your head and pray for salvation.**  God listens, and now you're under the effects of a quest spell.
4. **Wake up in the forest.** GM secretly rolls to determine which adjacent hex you end up in.
5. **Late-night caterwauling.** Unable to speak coherently for 3 1d3 days, this prevents spellcasting.
6. **Minor misunderstanding with local authorities.**  Check CHA: on success, pay a fine of 2d6 * 25 gold; on failure (or inability to pay the fine), 1d6 days in prison.
7. **Insult local person of rank.**  Check CHA: on success, they are amenable to some sort of apology and reparations.
8. **Gambling losses.**  Roll the dice as if you caroused again to see how much is lost (no additional XP).
9. **Gain local reputation as the life of the party.**  Check CHA: on failure, all future carousing in this settlement costs double due to hangers-on.
10. **Hangover.**  First day of adventuring is at -2 to all rolls.  Casters must roll Int or Wis checks with each spell to avoid casting failure.
11. **Make a fool of yourself in public.**  Gain half XP.  Check CHA or gain reputation in this settlement as a drunken lout.
12. **Involved in random brawl.**  Check STR or lose d6 HP (to a minimum of 1).
13. **Gambling binge.**   Lose all your gold, gems, jewellery.  Check WIS for each magic item in your possession: on failure, it is gone.
14. **Whisked away to Fairy.** Consult the A Night in Fairy table.
15. **Beaten and robbed.** Lose all your gold, gems, jewellery, and are reduced to half hit points.
16. **Major misunderstanding with local authorities.**  Imprisoned until fines and bribes totalling 1d6 * 1000 gold paid.  All weapons, armour, and magic items confiscated.
17. **Wake up in the forest.** GM secretly rolls to determine which adjacent hex you end up in.
18. **Get in way over your head and pray for salvation.**  God listens, and now you're under the effects of a quest spell.

   *Terrified Friar:*

   - Josprey

5. **1 Doggelganger (OSE)** in a little camp, asleep.  In the guise of a pedlar,
   but the story doesn't quite add up: he doesn't know what his goods are, or
   their prices, and asks where the PCs think the best place for him to sell his

### Magic Items

- **Sword of Sir Chyde:**
  - +2 to hit and damage vs fairies
  - Glows in the presence of fairies

- **Horned Crown of the Hydrogyle** (not found)
  - The owner can expend spell slots to power it up.  Powers are gained and it
    grows to completeness as it absorbs more power:
    - **0 (knucklebone):** attracted, as if magnetically, towards the nearest nodal stone
    - **5 (bone finger):** if in a hex with a ley line, aligns itself along its course
    - **15 (tiara made of bone):** when worn, gives knowledge of nodal stones within 3 hexes; feels *right* to empower: when preparing spells in the morning, resisting giving it at least 1 slot requires a Save vs Spells if worn the previous day
    - **25 (circlet made of bone):** when worn, gives the ability to travel astrally along a ley line at 24 miles per hour; feels *right* to wear: taking it off requires a Save vs Spells
    - **50 (crown made of bone):** when worn, acts as a *ring of controlling humans*; mild paranoia when others suggest the crown may not be a good thing: who are others to question it? the crown is yours, it came to you!
    - **75 (little balls of greenflame hovering above the points):** when worn, adds *burning greenflame* effect to all weapons, and allows using a Cottager Sigil once per day; strong paranoia: everyone sees how great and mighty the crown has made you, they want to take it for themselves!  but returning to being the *nobody* you were before finding the crown is too awful to contemplate!
    - **100 (a very imposing glowing crown made of bone; complete):** confers the *awful presence* effect; fuses itself to the skull
  - Drune will recognise it from level 15 onwards
  - Audrunes and the Elder Phanatarch will be aware of anyone using the astral travel power

### Riddles

1. "I have towns without people, forests without trees, and rivers without
   water.  Man is my father.  What am I?"

   **a map**

2. "What has a golden head and a golden tail, but no body?"

   **a coin**

3. "What does man love more than life; fear more than death, or mortal strife;
   what the poor have, the rich require, and what contented men desire; what
   misers spend, and spendthrifts save, and all men carry to the grave?"

   **nothing**

4. "What always runs, but never walks; often murmurs, but never talks; has a
   bed, but never sleeps; and an open mouth, that never eats?"

   **a river**

5. "What is alive without breath; as old as death; clad in mail, never clinking;
   never thirsty, ever drinking?"

   **a fish**

6. "What falls, but does not break; and what breaks but does not fall?"

   **night and day**

7. "I am rarely touched, but often held; if you have wit, you'll use me well."

   **a tongue**

8. "The more you have of it, the less you see.  What is it?"

   **darkness**

9. "I am the beginning of eternity, the end of time and space; the beginning of
   every end, the the end of every place.  What am I?"

   **the letter 'e'**

10. "What is so fragile that even speaking its name will break it?"

    **silence**

### Secrets

[Secrets // The Staff of the Apostle]: campaign-notes-2022-06-cartographic-curiosities.html#the-staff-of-the-apostle

#### The Staff of the Apostle

A day spent doing research in a large library or church archive (eg, Harrowmoor
Keep, Castle Brackenwold) reveals the following:

- The Staff of the Apostle is a relic in the possession of the church, said to
  have the power to vanquish demons.
- It was traditionally used as part of the ritual for burning heretics at the
  stake, with the evil drawn from them (only if they repented, of course) into
  the staff, so that their souls would merely go to purgatory and not to hell.
- But witch burning has fallen out of favour these past 500 years.

Additional research with a suitable scholar or in church archives reveals:

- The staff has been missing for 500 years, and that's why witch burning has
  died off in Dolmenwood (can't do the proper ritual).
- The last burning was of all the members, including the high priestess, a woman
  with shining blue eyes, of a heretical sect which combined church doctrine
  with pagan beliefs.
- Most repented, out of fear of eternal damnation, but this high priestess was
  unrepentent to the very end, saying that her only crime was to worship the
  Gwyrigons, the three mighty archangels which God had appointed to watch over
  His creation, and that worshipping the power of God is no sin.
- (religious player characters don't know of any "three mighty archangels" or
  "Gwyrigons")

------------------------

### Prep

#### Session 0

1. **Premise:** cartography, everyone still happy with this?
2. **Game style:**
   - This is an OSR game: creative problem-solving is rewarded; the
     answer isn't on your character sheet; things are not balanced:
     the world is a real place, it won't all be level-appropriate, it
     will react to what you do, and to what you *don't* do.
   - It'll be very self-directed: I will provide rumours to
     investigate and NPCs to interact with, but I don't have a story
     to tell and what you engage with is up to you.
   - By default, politics will be off in the background, but if you
     want to get involved in that sort of thing there are plenty of
     factions: there's the Duke of Brackenwold, the various noble
     houses his vassals, the Church, the magical guilds, the Nag Lord,
     the rulers and wealthy families of the towns, the Drune, and you
     represent the greater authority of the Empire.
   - Much of what happens will be procedurally driven, there's rules
     for camping, fishing, foraging, weather, etc, and it's all very
     flavourful and fun.
   - Resource tracking is also going to be a big thing: when in town
     you'll need to pay for food and lodgings, and when adventuring
     you'll need to make sure you have enough food, torches,
     retainers, and any other supplies.
   - You get XP for gold, exploration, and carousing.
   - XP is divided evenly amongst surviving characters when you return
     to town, retainers who participated get a half share.
3. **Rules:**
   - PDF handouts
   - Character Creation handout
   - Optional & House Rules handout
4. **Character creation:**
   - Note: spells are learned diegetically!
   - Do this quick!
   - Mention uploads directory in file browser
5. **Logistics:**
   - Hex mapping
   - Dungeon mapping
   - Decide whether they have the player map
6. **Roll for start date.**
7. **Begin!**

#### Opening

> After making the long journey west along the King's Road, you
> arrived at Castle Brackenwold, the largest city in the region and
> capital of the duchy.  Looming over the city, built atop a hill, is
> the castle itself, surrounded by pomp and grandeur.  Around the base
> of the hill, which is called Clod's Seat, is the Inner City, the
> commercial hub of Castle Brackenwold with all its markets, courts,
> institutions of learning, the mighty Cathedral of St. Signis, and so
> on.  Finally, surrounding the Inner City in a great sprawling mass
> of teetering abodes, twisting alleyways, and seedy taverns, is the
> Outer City, home of the commonfolk of Castle Brackenwold.
>
> You've spent a few unsuccessful [weeks / days] in the city trying to
> get an audience with the Duke, or at least one of his senior
> officials, regarding the topic of mapping Dolmenwood, and any aid or
> information they can provide to that end.  It's the Empresses'
> command, after all.
>
> ...well, ok, it's not *strictly speaking* the Empresses' command,
> it's the command of the Royal Geographical Institute.  But certainly
> the Institute is highly valued by the Empress, and certainly she
> would value accurate maps of this remote border region just as
> highly, but it's not entirely accurate to say you were sent by the
> Empress herself.
>
> Or so the bureaucratic peons were quick to inform you, upon seeing
> your imperial writ.
>
> And so, now, you stand once more upon the road.  The Horse-Eye road
> which leads north-west from Castle Brackenwold to the town of
> Prigwort, a fairly central settlement within Dolmenwood itself, and
> famed for its breweries and distilleries.  "Don't be a stranger!"
> the bureaucrats said, "you're welcome to return any time!" "But
> maybe you should start your mapping, hmm?"
>
> They did at least mention that the Church would be very interested
> in knowing the locations of any old shrines you uncover, as so many
> have been lost for generations.

### Prep

#### Rumours

- The Church are building a force to reclaim the Abbey of St Clewyd.
- The Duke is building a force to assault the Nagwood.

#### Drouge

- Will want to know what happened (if they tell him they don't have the ring) or
  will start to ask when they plan to go fetch it for him (if they say nothing).
- If they just try to lie and say the ring wasn't there, they'll need to
  convince him someone else stole it, since he *knows* there was a ring.
- If they tell him the truth he'll be both impressed and afraid that the barrier
  between Dolmenwood and Frigia may be coming undone.  He doesn't know how it
  works, or even that it was the Drune who set it up (though he'll be
  unsurprised to learn that, they are a likely candidate).
  - The Drune assume everyone still knows about the Triple Compact.

#### Fairy treasure

- Will need selling at a market.

- At The Breath of the Kelpie
- Upcoming:
  - 24 Iggwyld: pay retainers
  - 3 Chysting: renew room at the Clashed Antler

### Prep

#### Rumours

- The Order of St Signis has set up a camp at the ruined Abbey of St Clewyd.
- The Duke and the Church have founded a new military order, the Order of the
  Wood, to oppose the forces of chaos.  The Order is preparing to attack the
  crookhorns who have settled in the centre-north of the Wood, the region
  supposedly under the control of the mythical Nag Lord.

#### The Cold Prince's Mortal Agent

- Wymond Browne
- A well-dressed fat little man, wearing pince-nez glasses which he keeps
  fiddling with, middle-aged, red in the face and very sweaty.  He speaks with a
  fake-sounding posh accent, occasionally a bit of common accent slips out.
  Every few minutes he dabs his face with a purple handkerchief.
- Has tracked down the fairy gems to the Clashed Antler, and is waiting there
  for the party (i.e., whoever comes to visit that room)
  - He arrived on 20 Iggwyld, which Blino or Sespetra can tell the party
- Approaches the party, asking for news from out of town:
  - Says he's "a historian, a folklorist, an antiquarian, a lover of all things
    old, musty, fusty, and dusty"
  - Turns the conversation to the Drune, insinuates they're bad; then turns the
    conversation to the Frost Elves, insinuates they're misunderstood.
  - Carefully, but not very subtly, watching everyone's reactions.
  - If directly confronted, says "Well, we don't really know what the rule of
    the Frost Elves was like, do we?  All we have are old stories which make out
    the Drune, of all people, to be the heroes of the day.  I am interested in
    the truth."
  - If he thinks the party may be swayable to the Cold Prince (or at least,
    against the Drune), says he's interested in the comings and goings of the
    Drune, slides across a fancy-looking silver coin (10gp), and says he can be
    found at Raptappen's Quadrant, and leaves.

        - The Drune say they do this to protect the village
        - He was told about this, and sworn into secrecy, by the previous
          Headman
        - As far as he knows, this has been going on for centuries
        - He doesn't know if the Drune are telling the truth, and suspects their

-------------------------

<aside class="highlight">This was a 1-on-1 Lillibeth focussed session.</aside>

### Intro

- Session recap
- Talk about the Drune, the Triple Compact, the Cold Prince, etc

### State

- 22 Iggwyld (afternoon): clement, cheery
- Lillibeth in 0505, facing 4 Drune cottagers, her back to a cliff

### Prep

- Outline:
  - Lillibeth is disarmed and magicked (Detect Magic & Detect Illusion)
  - Lillibeth is taken to the Drune cottage
  - Lillibeth is interrogated
    - Only Limnis and his family live on the island, the rest converged from
      elsewhere in the hex when they saw Lillibeth flying in
  3. Made to stay until Drunemoot on the night of the 24th
     - Told that if she flees the island, her and the party will be considered
       agents of the Cold Prince and hunted down.
     - Deregbra will be intensely interested in her and monopolise her time if
       possible
     - Deregbra very proudly introduces her to Darren, her secret boyfriend from
       Fort Vulgar, he's a *fisherman*('s son)---isn't that *wonderful?*
  4. Be taken to Drunemoot
- Drune characteristics:
  - Very pale
  - Hair is straight and black
  - Tall

#### Drune cottage

- A quaint little cottage with a little vegetable garden, in a clearing
  Lillibeth is sure wasn't there before
- Kilnling turns its clay head and stares at Lillibeth as she approaches
- Limnis (cottager), Polldra (drunewife), Deregbra (braithmaid), 4 other
  children (run from Lillibeth and watch her from a safe distance)

#### Interrogation

- **What they want to know:**
  - Who Lillibeth is
  - How she got there
  - What she knows
  - Whether she is an agent of the Cold Prince
- **What they know:**
  - That the barrier at Sir Chyde's tomb was weak
  - That Lillibeth came soaring through the air towards Hoarblight Keep
  - The descriptions of the party at the Gorthstone (from Haygral's
    description)---and they will connect that with Lillibeth if she mentions
    being from Prigwort, the Gorthstone, Sir Chyde's sword, the fight, etc
- **What they don't know:**
  - That Sir Chyde's ghost gave the party his sword (though the sword is still
    the property of the Drune in their eyes)
  - That the barrier at Sir Chyde's tomb had weakened enough to allow mortals to
    pass through
  - That the barrier at Sir Chyde's tomb has now repaired itself
- **What they assume:**
  - That Lillibeth is at best a meddler planning to rob Hoarblight Keep of its
    fairy treasures and at worst an agent of the Cold Prince working to restore
    him---especially so if they realise Lillibeth is one of those tresspassing
    murderers

#### Drunemoot

- About a dozen Drune present
- Cadfan of the Aegis presiding
- A misunderstanding is no excuse for murder and tresspass, but the party have
  the opportunity to prove their honesty and make amends by assisting the
  Drune---without asking unnecessary questions:
  - Bring them a man from Prigwort who has been paying people in fairy coinage
    and ice jewels for information about the Drune.
  - This is only the first task.
  - They will be watching.

### Notes

- 22 to 24 Iggwyld:
  - **0505---Hoarblight Keep and the Isle of Yeth:**
    - Lillibeth is honest and open with the Drune and tells them everything:
      - Including that they all went to Frigia
    - Deregbra befriends Lillibeth:
      - Says that witches live for centuries and worship the Gwyrigons, "but
        don't tell anyone I told you that, it's a secret!"
      - Says that the ley lines make the world work, "or something, you'd have
        to ask dad, but he wouldn't tell you"
      - Says that the Audrunes watch over the ley lines
    - Drunemoot:
      - Cadfan says the party are likely not agents of the Cold Prince working
        towards his restoration, and so have an opportunity to prove that and
        that the whole thing was a big misunderstanding: if they assist the
        Drune with an unspecified number of tasks.

  movements of the Drune, currently located in Prigwort
- Upcoming:

### Prep

#### Castle Brackenwold

- **Rumours:**
  - The Dukes of Brackenwold have elven ancestors.  Each new Duke must send his
    first-born daughter to the Lords of Fairy, in order to secure his rule over
    Dolmenwood.
- **Hooks:**
  - Monarch's Hill (1508) is haunted.
  - The ghosts of 12 friars haunt an abandoned chapel in hex 1607, and lay their
    curse on those who are not sufficiently righteous.
  - The Titheland Cidery in 1508 seems to be having difficulties, they've not
    sold any new stock this year and whenever the cidermasters are in town they
    seem pretty worried about something
  - Down at Shankswell Cross, in hex 1509, there's a magical wishing well which
    tells secrets.
- **Quests:**
  - Join the Enchanter's Guild: perform a spell (as proof you can do magic), and
    overcome *The Tower of Infinite Madness!!!* (funhouse dungeon: plan this if
    the players want it).
  - Join the College of the Imperial Institute of Physicks and Sorcerers: bring
    a letter of recommendation, have your magical power (level) measured, and
    contribute a new rare book to the library (Stygian Library Progress 30 or an
    Extraordinary Book of spells).
  - Find one of the lost shrines for the Church.

#### Prigwort

- **Quests:**
  - Sir Abygail requests that they scout out Crookhorn bases in the Nagwood.
  - Mostlemyre Drouge has heard a rumour that the Black Book of Llareggub is in
    a wyrm's lair near Fog Lake.  He'll pay 5000gp for it.
  - Wyrmspittle (if they visit him) wants them to go gather Frisk from hex 1005,
    he'll pay 30gp per portion.

#### Fort Vulgar

- **Hooks:**
  - The story of Sir Tegwyn the Disloyal, lover of the Lady of Spring Unending,
    an elf-maiden of great beauty.  He betrayed her, seduced her one of her
    maids, and when the Lady discovered the infidelity she cursed Sir Tegwyn to
    never rest, and now his ghost haunts the Northern Scratch.
  - A Chooker prophesying doom for all mortals, with some locals looking on
    pityingly.
- **Quests:**
  - Alfolonious Heape bursts into the tavern and loudly cries "fairies stole my
    wife!" (see hex 0705)

#### The Drune

- **Hooks:**
  - As the drune approach quietly talking amongst themselves, overhear
    "Gheillough must be awoken soon, before it is too late"
- **Quests:**
  - Investigate the tower of hex 1007 and determine if it's a Frost Elf
    incursion.
  - Slay Chasobrithe or the Big Chook.
  - Locate an Atacorn for them.

#### The Cold Prince's Mortal Agent

- As described in session 8 notes
- Be very open that he's working to aid the return of the Cold Prince, as soon
  as he figures out that the PCs want to give him to the Drune.
- If he thinks he can't escape he tries to stab one of the squishier-looking PCs
  (eg Molly or Lillibeth) with a +1 dagger (of Frost Elf make) to create a
  distraction.

### Notes

- Recall that Lillibeth is already a member of the Imperial Institute

- 29 Iggwyld: brisk, clear (mid afternoon)
  - **1508---Castle Brackenwold and Monarch's Hill:**
    - Lillibeth goes to the Imperial Institute and researches:
      - **Water Weirds:** a dragon or something living in Lake Longmere, named
        Gheillough, connected to the ley lines in some way.  The Drune and
        Witches likely more.
      - **Ley Lines:** general non-Dolmenwood specific information (they're
        lines of arcane power connected to the planet somehow) and a note that
        investigations into the ley lines of Dolmenwood havebeen delayed by the
        Drune killing everyone who tries it
    - Molly goes to the Seminary to research water weirds and meets Abbot
      Hargle, who:
      - Tells her that the library doesn't have anything about magical beasts
      - Seems interested in the Drune when Molly mentions them (but doesn't ask
        her anything)
      - When she asks about why the Drune might use their magic to help a town,
        explains that there are many forces of evil, and they are thankfully not
        united (eg, the Lords of Fairy and whatever nature gods the Drune
        worship), so it's possible for a sinner to fight against some other
        evil.
    - Paulo goes to the Episcopal Library to research water weirds and learns
      about Big Chook, a monster which appeared 400 years ago and attacks ships
      in Lake Longmere, single-handedly ending cross-lake travel.

- 30 Iggwyld: brisk, clear
  - **1508---Castle Brackenwold and Monarch's Hill:**
    - Leave and travel the road to Prigwort
  - **1106---Prigwort and the Swinney Tower:**
    - Sir Abygail asks for locations of Crookhorn encampments in the Nagwood
    - Hire a thief to rob the Cold Prince's Mortal Agent, he returns with a
      diary / book of accounts which starts as a normal merchant's journal but
      turns fairy:
      - He meets with "Lady Misthraine" who hires him to "collect information",
        and pays a very large sum of money
      - In following entries, he quickly stops normal merchant dealings and is
        instead paying for information about the movements of the Drune
      - Another meeting with "Lady Misthraine", she is disappointed with
        progress, "WHERE ARE THE SUMMERSTONES???" in big letters, circled; she
        gives him more money
    - Kidnap him, sneak out of town, and set up camp in the woods

- 1 Chysting: low cloud, mist
  - **1106---Prigwort and the Swinney Tower:**
    - Lillibeth questions the guy (they never ask his name):
      - He tries to pay for his freedom.  Denied.
      - He says he is working with the Frost Elves and the Cold Prince, yes, but
        could they be so bad?  Everyone decides he's evil.
      - He says that if the fear of the Drune is the problem, why not join him?
        Work with the Cold Prince!  Everyone decides he's *definitely* evil.
    - Head to Fort Vulgar, keeping off the road and hidden in the mist
  - **0805---Prigmarinn Hill:**
    - Dismiss horses
  - **0705---The Scrabey Who Forgot His Name:**
    - Camp out for the night

- 2 Chysting: hot, humid
  - **0705---The Scrabey Who Forgot His Name:**
    - Decide to split up: Lillibeth goes to Fort Vulgar to hire a ship to cross
      the Upper Hameth, the rest go cross-country to avoid being seen, they'll
      bribe the boatman to not say anything.
  - **0604---Fort Vulgar and the Galoshers' Pool:**
    - Enact plan (bribe boatman 5gp)

  - **0505---Hoarblight Keep and the Isle of Yeth:**
    - Find a Drune in meditation speaking to ravens
    - Overhear "Gehillough must be awoken soon, before it is too late"
    - Hand over their prisoner, get warned to keep out of trouble next time
    - Return to town

2023-02-04 --- Break 1.1
------------------------

We played the ALIEN scenario *Chariot of the Gods*.

### Intro

> Welcome to Alien, I will be your Game Mother as we play the cinematic scenario
> *Chariot of the Gods*, which I expect to take probably three sessions.
>
> Alien's a bit different from other games we've played before, so before we get
> started I just want to summarise some key aspects of the setting and the
> system, which I think if we lean strongly into we'll have a much more fun
> time.
>
> If I had to summarise the genre it's retro-futuristic hyper-capitalist space
> horror.  There's intelligent androids, space colonies, and FTL travel, but
> also computers are room-sized mainframes, everything uses green monochrome CRT
> monitors, and space ships look kind of like flying oil refineries, with
> exposed piping and wiring everywhere.  Everything's kind of dirty, run down,
> and unreliable.  Big chunky buttons, analogue devices, all that good stuff.
> Out here in space, you belong to the megacorps, who run everything.  They view
> individual human lives as just interchangeable cogs of no inherent value, and
> company representatives are basically kings, or high priests of their
> corporate gods.
>
> You're all the crew of a ship, the USCSS Montero a commercial starfreighter
> owned by Weyland-Yutani, you're colleagues, you all get on to a greater or
> lesser extent, but you're not like a traditional RPG party.  If you all look
> at your character sheets, you may have a buddy or a rival, or both, and you
> all have a personal agenda.  Don't tell the other players what those agendas
> are, and use them to help roleplay your character.  These agendas will change
> over time: this is a three-act scenario, so you'll get a new agenda at the
> start of acts 2 and 3.
>
> If I think you actively advance your agenda, going out of your way to do so,
> at personal risk or sacrifice, at the end of each act you can earn a story
> point, which you can spend for an automatic success on a roll.  Story points
> belong to you, the player, not your character, so if your character dies and
> you take over an NPC you'll keep those story points, and if we play another
> Alien scenario in the future, you'll start with any left over story points.
>
> As your agendas are both personal and secret, you might find they'll drive you
> into conflict with other characters.  Possibly even towards PvP.  That's fine,
> that's more than fine, that's fun: lean into it, don't think "oh, but we're a
> party, we have to work together".  In Alien, everyone is out for themselves.
> And if you want to do something secret without the other players knowing, just
> message me on Discord.  I'll leave that up to your judgement.
>
> I'll pause now for a few minutes for you to look at your character sheets,
> read through everything, make sure it all makes sense, and then we'll begin.
> So everyone let me know when you're ready to go.

Read *What's the story Mother?*

> Coming out of hypersleep is never a pleasant experience.  In fact, you all
> feel like shit.  You're dehydrated, hungry, a few of you might have a headache
> starting.  You can just thank your lucky stars that on this run at least you
> only need to sleep a few months at a time, it gets worse the longer you're
> under.  If there's one thing you can say about Weyland-Yutani, it's that they
> don't prioritise unprofitable nonsense, like improving the comfort of their
> workers.
>
> So let's just go 'round the group and by way of introduction each of you just
> describe what the process of you waking up is like.  Like, do you laze around
> a bit, or immediately get a shower and get dressed, maybe talk to someone, or
> maybe just stumble bleary-eyed straight to the galley for some coffee or bug
> juice.
