Pitch
-----

You are a group of cartographers from the imperial capital Endon, far
off to the south east, appointed by Royal Decree to come to the
backwater, out-of-the-way, and downright weird Duchy of Brackenwold,
to comprehensively map out the Dolmenwood, something the local rulers
have somehow never managed.  And speaking of those local rulers,
they’re not quite sure how to act with you noble folk hanging around.
The Duchy was once a kingdom in its own right, and has been largely
left to its own devices since being annexed by the Empire some 600
years ago.  In principle everyone here is honour-bound to help you out
as best they can but, well, Endon is far away and you might not find
them as cooperative as they could be.

There are strange stories about the Dolmenwood, some folk say there’s
all manner of weird fairy creatures living beneath its tangled
branches; that it was once ruled by a fearsome frost elf known as the
Cold Prince, who hungers to reclaim his mortal territory once more;
and that it’s now threatened by some sort of chaos being from the
unclaimed northlands.  These rural folk, I tell you…


House rules
-----------

### Character creation

#### Ability Scores

Roll 4d6 drop lowest, in order.

#### Races

Humans only.

#### Classes

| Class       | Book                               | Page | Requirements       | Prime Requisite |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------- | ---- | ------------------ | --------------- |
| Cleric      | OSE Advanced Fantasy Player's Tome | 36   | None               | WIS             |
| Druid       | OSE Advanced Fantasy Player's Tome | 40   | None               | WIS             |
| Fighter     | OSE Advanced Fantasy Player's Tome | 50   | None               | STR             |
| Illusionist | OSE Advanced Fantasy Player's Tome | 62   | DEX >= 9           | INT             |
| Magic-User  | OSE Advanced Fantasy Player's Tome | 66   | None               | INT             |
| Thief       | OSE Advanced Fantasy Player's Tome | 74   | None               | DEX             |
| Friar       | Dolmenwood Player's Book           | 36   | None               | WIS             |
| Hunter      | Dolmenwood Player's Book           | 40   | CON >= 9, WIS >= 9 | DEX             |
| Knight      | Dolmenwood Player's Book           | 42   | CON >= 9, DEX >= 9 | STR             |
| Minstrel    | Dolmenwood Player's Book           | 44   | INT >= 9           | CHA, DEX        |

Note that **Clerics**, **Illusionists**, and **Magic-Users** belong to
one of the organisations listed on page 51 of the **Dolmenwood
Player's Book**.

Furthermore, **Clerics** and **Friars** all belong to the Church of
the One True God, the state religion of the Empire, of which the local
religious head is the Bishop of Brackenwold.

#### Alignments

Only **Lawful** or **Neutral**.  No **Chaotic** characters.

#### Known Languages

We're using the languages from the **Dolmenwood Player's Book**.

**Woldish** is the Common of this setting.  Everyone has that for
free.  Then you get a number of additional languages based on your INT
score:

- **Gaffe**, the language of the Shorthorns, the goatfolk commonalty
  of the High Wold.
- **Caprice**, the language of the Longhorns, the goatfolk noblility
  of the High Wold.
- **Sylvan**, the common tongue of the fairies found frequently
  visiting the mortal world.
- Clerics, Friars, and those with connections to the Church may also
  choose **Liturgic**, the holy tongue of scripture and sermon.
- The educated or noble may also choose **Old Woldish**, the historic
  and now-dead original version of Woldish.
- Non-locals may also choose **Imperial Common**, the language of the
  wider empire, not really used around here.

If you want to think in real-world terms, **Old Woldish** is like
Anglo-Saxon, **Imperial Common** like Norman French, and **Woldish**
is Middle English, the bastard offspring of the two.  Knowing
**Woldish** means you'll recognise a few words in the others, but not
enough to communicate.  **Liturgic** is the Latin of this setting.

There are no alignment languages.  Alignment languages are silly.

#### Starting Money & Equipment

Roll for quick-start equipment, as described on page 76 of the
**Dolmenwood Player's Book**.

#### Starting Spells (Illusionist & Magic-User)

Roll N unique numbers on 1d12 (determined by your INT, see page 124 of
the **Advanced Fantasy Player's Tome**) and pick those spells from the
relevant level 1 lists (page 130 for **Illusionists**, page 131 for
**Magic-Users**).

#### Birth Date & Moon Sign

- Roll for the birth date in the Dolmenwood calendar (page 98 of the
  **Dolmenwood Player's Book**): 1d12 and then 1d28, 1d30, or 1d31.
- Check the **Dolmenwood Calendar** to see if this is a feast day.
- Check what moon sign this is (pages 102 & 103 of the **Dolmenwood
  Player's Book**), which confers a minor mechanical benefit.

### Optional rules

This list does not contain referee-facing rules like morale rules,
only the rules which directly affect players.

- **OSE Advanced Fantasy Player's Tome:**
  - Ascending AC
  - Arcane spellcasters can wield staves
  - Advanced spellbook rules
  - Detailed encumbrance
  - Attacking with two weapons
  - Parrying
  - Splash weapons

- **Dolmenwood Player's Book:**
  - Inebriation
  - Smoking
  - Camping

### XP for exploration

- Exploring a hex gives 100xp (each) for the first hex, 200xp for the
  second, 300xp for the third (etc), resetting when you return to a
  town.
- Overcoming a hidden thing (intentionally left vague) gives 50xp, on
  top of any other XP gained doing that.

Exploration XP, like gold XP, is gained upon returning to a town.

### Carousing

Once per session in a civilised settlement, a PC may choose to Carouse
to gain additional XP.  A PC who goes carousing must choose to spend a
certain amount of gold, limited by the size of the settlement:

- **Village:** 1d6 * 100 gold spent / XP gained
- **Town:** 1d8 * 150 gold spent / XP gained
- **City:** 1d10 * 200 gold spent / XP gained

In any given settlement, carousers may choose to roll for a smaller
entry.

If the amount of gold spent is more than the PC has, and the party
cannot (or won't) cover it, the PC is now in debt to someone nefarious
and must Save vs Poison or roll for a mishap.

If the die result is higher than the PC's level, they must roll for a
mishap.

#### Mishaps (3d6)

3. **Get in way over your head and pray for salvation.**  God listens, and now you're under the effects of a quest spell.
4. **Wake up in the forest.** GM secretly rolls to determine which adjacent hex you end up in.
5. **Late-night caterwauling.** Unable to speak coherently for 3 1d3 days, this prevents spellcasting.
6. **Minor misunderstanding with local authorities.**  Check CHA: on success, pay a fine of 2d6 * 25 gold; on failure (or inability to pay the fine), 1d6 days in prison.
7. **Insult local person of rank.**  Check CHA: on success, they are amenable to some sort of apology and reparations.
8. **Gambling losses.**  Roll the dice as if you caroused again to see how much is lost (no additional XP).
9. **Gain local reputation as the life of the party.**  Check CHA: on failure, all future carousing in this settlement costs double due to hangers-on.
10. **Hangover.**  First day of adventuring is at -2 to all rolls.  Casters must roll Int or Wis checks with each spell to avoid casting failure.
11. **Make a fool of yourself in public.**  Gain half XP.  Check CHA or gain reputation in this settlement as a drunken lout.
12. **Involved in random brawl.**  Check STR or lose d6 HP (to a minimum of 1).
13. **Gambling binge.**   Lose all your gold, gems, jewellery.  Check WIS for each magic item in your possession: on failure, it is gone.
14. **Whisked away to Fairy.** Consult the A Night in Fairy table.
15. **Beaten and robbed.** Lose all your gold, gems, jewellery, and are reduced to half hit points.
16. **Major misunderstanding with local authorities.**  Imprisoned until fines and bribes totalling 1d6 * 1000 gold paid.  All weapons, armour, and magic items confiscated.
17. **Wake up in the forest.** GM secretly rolls to determine which adjacent hex you end up in.
18. **Get in way over your head and pray for salvation.**  God listens, and now you're under the effects of a quest spell.

### Prep

#### Session 0

1. **Premise:** cartography, everyone still happy with this?
2. **Game style:**
   - This is an OSR game: creative problem-solving is rewarded; the
     answer isn't on your character sheet; things are not balanced:
     the world is a real place, it won't all be level-appropriate, it
     will react to what you do, and to what you *don't* do.
   - It'll be very self-directed: I will provide rumours to
     investigate and NPCs to interact with, but I don't have a story
     to tell and what you engage with is up to you.
   - By default, politics will be off in the background, but if you
     want to get involved in that sort of thing there are plenty of
     factions: there's the Duke of Brackenwold, the various noble
     houses his vassals, the Church, the magical guilds, the Nag Lord,
     the rulers and wealthy families of the towns, the Drune, and you
     represent the greater authority of the Empire.
   - Much of what happens will be procedurally driven, there's rules
     for camping, fishing, foraging, weather, etc, and it's all very
     flavourful and fun.
   - Resource tracking is also going to be a big thing: when in town
     you'll need to pay for food and lodgings, and when adventuring
     you'll need to make sure you have enough food, torches,
     retainers, and any other supplies.
   - You get XP for gold, exploration, and carousing.
   - XP is divided evenly amongst surviving characters when you return
     to town, retainers who participated get a half share.
3. **Rules:**
   - PDF handouts
   - Character Creation handout
   - Optional & House Rules handout
4. **Character creation:**
   - Note: spells are learned diegetically!
   - Do this quick!
   - Mention uploads directory in file browser
5. **Logistics:**
   - Hex mapping
   - Dungeon mapping
   - Decide whether they have the player map
6. **Roll for start date.**
7. **Begin!**

#### Opening

> After making the long journey west along the King's Road, you
> arrived at Castle Brackenwold, the largest city in the region and
> capital of the duchy.  Looming over the city, built atop a hill, is
> the castle itself, surrounded by pomp and grandeur.  Around the base
> of the hill, which is called Clod's Seat, is the Inner City, the
> commercial hub of Castle Brackenwold with all its markets, courts,
> institutions of learning, the mighty Cathedral of St. Signis, and so
> on.  Finally, surrounding the Inner City in a great sprawling mass
> of teetering abodes, twisting alleyways, and seedy taverns, is the
> Outer City, home of the commonfolk of Castle Brackenwold.
>
> You've spent a few unsuccessful [weeks / days] in the city trying to
> get an audience with the Duke, or at least one of his senior
> officials, regarding the topic of mapping Dolmenwood, and any aid or
> information they can provide to that end.  It's the Empresses'
> command, after all.
>
> ...well, ok, it's not *strictly speaking* the Empresses' command,
> it's the command of the Royal Geographical Institute.  But certainly
> the Institute is highly valued by the Empress, and certainly she
> would value accurate maps of this remote border region just as
> highly, but it's not entirely accurate to say you were sent by the
> Empress herself.
>
> Or so the bureaucratic peons were quick to inform you, upon seeing
> your imperial writ.
>
> And so, now, you stand once more upon the road.  The Horse-Eye road
> which leads north-west from Castle Brackenwold to the town of
> Prigwort, a fairly central settlement within Dolmenwood itself, and
> famed for its breweries and distilleries.  "Don't be a stranger!"
> the bureaucrats said, "you're welcome to return any time!" "But
> maybe you should start your mapping, hmm?"
>
> They did at least mention that the Church would be very interested
> in knowing the locations of any old shrines you uncover, as so many
> have been lost for generations.
