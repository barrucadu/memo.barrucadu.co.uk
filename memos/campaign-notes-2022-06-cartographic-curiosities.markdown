<aside class="highlight">This campaign is ongoing and this memo contains spoilers.</aside>

Overview
--------

### Pitch

> You are a group of cartographers from the imperial capital Endon, far off to
> the south east, appointed by Royal Decree to come to the backwater,
> out-of-the-way, and downright weird Duchy of Brackenwold, to comprehensively
> map out the Dolmenwood, something the local rulers have somehow never managed.
> And speaking of those local rulers, they’re not quite sure how to act with you
> noble folk hanging around.  The Duchy was once a kingdom in its own right, and
> has been largely left to its own devices since being annexed by the Empire
> some 600 years ago.  In principle everyone here is honour-bound to help you
> out as best they can but, well, Endon is far away and you might not find them
> as cooperative as they could be.
>
> There are strange stories about the Dolmenwood, some folk say there’s all
> manner of weird fairy creatures living beneath its tangled branches; that it
> was once ruled by a fearsome frost elf known as the Cold Prince, who hungers
> to reclaim his mortal territory once more; and that it’s now threatened by
> some sort of chaos being from the unclaimed northlands.  These rural folk, I
> tell you...

### Game Log

- **Session 0.** Discussed what sort of campaign we wanted, created characters.
  Characters entered Dolmenwood through the Wenchgate, get robbed by the bakers.

- **Session 1: Mr Rag-and-bone.** Heard about Drune in the woods to the
  north-east, and about Violet Harrowmoor taken by bandits to the Abbey of St
  Clewyd.  Visit the abbey, see the kids, get driven away by Mr
  Rag-and-bone---but not before Maybelle is inflicted with death-rot!

- **Session 2: Knobbled Mandrake.** Learn that death-rot can be cured with
  knobbled mandrake.  Send word to Harrowmoor Keep about young Violet and head
  into the woods.  A wounded elf: more tales of Drune.  Meet Azeria and find the
  knobbled mandrake.  Return to Prigwort, get Maybelle cured, and hear that Lady
  Harrowmoor has a reward waiting.  Finally, get Mostlemyre Drouge's "help
  wanted" notice.

  Meet Arfred's tutor-knight, Sir Abygail Twinsor.  Delve into Sir Chyde's tomb,
  encounter the guardians, decide to leave and do some research.

  visits Harrowmoor Keep to get knighted.  Return to Sir Chyde's tomb: save a
  Moss Dwarf from a band of Redcaps, but barely escape with their lives.  Hire
  more retainers: strength in numbers!  Make it to the tomb, and deal with the
  guardians.

- **Session 6: Winter's Daughter.** Do the dungeon: wish for fairy horses from
  Princess Snowfall-at-Dusk.

- **Session 7: Gorthstone, Again.** Tell Drouge what went down at Sir Chyde's
  tomb.  Return to the Gorthstone.  Lillibeth copies down its runes.  Party
  kills a Drune who comes to drive them away.

- **Session 8: The Triple Compact.** Follow the road north-east of Prigwort to
  Odd.  Decline to participate in sprite genocide.  Talk to the sage and learn
  about the Triple Compact.  See the Drune doing something odd in the church at
  night.  Bully Broobe into telling them what's up.

- **Session 9: Fairy Roads.** Find the Willow Gate, and make it to King
  Pusskin's Road with only mild time dilation.  Check out Lankshorn.  Lillibeth

Note that **Clerics**, **Illusionists**, and **Magic-Users** belong to
one of the organisations listed on page 51 of the **Dolmenwood
Player's Book**.

Furthermore, **Clerics** and **Friars** all belong to the Church of
the One True God, the state religion of the Empire, of which the local
religious head is the Bishop of Brackenwold.

#### Hit Points

Take the maximum.

#### Alignments

Only **Lawful** or **Neutral**.  No **Chaotic** characters.

#### Known Languages

We're using the languages from the **Dolmenwood Player's Book**.

**Woldish** is the Common of this setting.  Everyone has that for
free.  Then you get a number of additional languages based on your INT
score:

- **Gaffe**, the language of the Shorthorns, the goatfolk commonalty
  of the High Wold.
- **Caprice**, the language of the Longhorns, the goatfolk noblility
  of the High Wold.
- **Sylvan**, the common tongue of the fairies found frequently
  visiting the mortal world.
- Clerics, Friars, and those with connections to the Church may also
  choose **Liturgic**, the holy tongue of scripture and sermon.
- The educated or noble may also choose **Old Woldish**, the historic
  and now-dead original version of Woldish.
- Non-locals may also choose **Imperial Common**, the language of the
  wider empire, not really used around here.

If you want to think in real-world terms, **Old Woldish** is like
Anglo-Saxon, **Imperial Common** like Norman French, and **Woldish**
is Middle English, the bastard offspring of the two.  Knowing
**Woldish** means you'll recognise a few words in the others, but not
enough to communicate.  **Liturgic** is the Latin of this setting.

There are no alignment languages.  Alignment languages are silly.

#### Starting Money & Equipment

Roll for quick-start equipment, as described on page 76 of the
**Dolmenwood Player's Book**.

#### Starting Spells (Illusionist & Magic-User)

Roll N unique numbers on 1d12 (determined by your INT, see page 124 of
the **Advanced Fantasy Player's Tome**) and pick those spells from the
relevant level 1 lists (page 130 for **Illusionists**, page 131 for
**Magic-Users**).

#### Birth Date & Moon Sign

- Roll for the birth date in the Dolmenwood calendar (page 98 of the
  **Dolmenwood Player's Book**): 1d12 and then 1d28, 1d30, or 1d31.
- Check the **Dolmenwood Calendar** to see if this is a feast day.
- Check what moon sign this is (pages 102 & 103 of the **Dolmenwood
  Player's Book**), which confers a minor mechanical benefit.

### Optional rules

This list does not contain referee-facing rules like morale rules,
only the rules which directly affect players.

- **OSE Advanced Fantasy Player's Tome:**
  - Ascending AC
  - Arcane spellcasters can wield staves
  - Advanced spellbook rules
  - Detailed encumbrance
  - Attacking with two weapons
  - Parrying
  - Splash weapons

- **Dolmenwood Player's Book:**
  - Inebriation
  - Smoking
  - Camping

### Hit Die is Damage Die

PCs roll their hit die to determine damage, instead of 1d6.  Damage of melee
attacks is still modified by STR.

### Hit Points

When you level up, take the maximum.

### Shields

If a physical hit takes you to 0HP or less, and you have a shield equipped, then
instead the shield is destroyed and you remain at 1HP.

### XP for Exploration

- Exploring a hex gives 100xp (each) for the first hex, 200xp for the
  second, 300xp for the third (etc), resetting when you return to a
  town.
- Overcoming a hidden thing (intentionally left vague) gives 50xp, on
  top of any other XP gained doing that.

Exploration XP, like gold XP, is gained upon returning to a town.

### XP for Carousing

Once per session in a civilised settlement, a PC may choose to Carouse
to gain additional XP.  A PC who goes carousing must choose to spend a
certain amount of gold, limited by the size of the settlement:

- **Village:** 1d6 * 100 gold spent / XP gained
- **Town:** 1d8 * 150 gold spent / XP gained
- **City:** 1d10 * 200 gold spent / XP gained

In any given settlement, carousers may choose to roll for a smaller
entry.

If the amount of gold spent is more than the PC has, and the party
cannot (or won't) cover it, the PC is now in debt to someone nefarious
and must Save vs Poison or roll for a mishap.

If the die result is higher than the PC's level, they must roll for a
mishap.

#### Mishaps (3d6)

3. **Get in way over your head and pray for salvation.**  God listens, and now you're under the effects of a quest spell.
4. **Wake up in the forest.** GM secretly rolls to determine which adjacent hex you end up in.
5. **Late-night caterwauling.** Unable to speak coherently for 3 1d3 days, this prevents spellcasting.
6. **Minor misunderstanding with local authorities.**  Check CHA: on success, pay a fine of 2d6 * 25 gold; on failure (or inability to pay the fine), 1d6 days in prison.
7. **Insult local person of rank.**  Check CHA: on success, they are amenable to some sort of apology and reparations.
8. **Gambling losses.**  Roll the dice as if you caroused again to see how much is lost (no additional XP).
9. **Gain local reputation as the life of the party.**  Check CHA: on failure, all future carousing in this settlement costs double due to hangers-on.
10. **Hangover.**  First day of adventuring is at -2 to all rolls.  Casters must roll Int or Wis checks with each spell to avoid casting failure.
11. **Make a fool of yourself in public.**  Gain half XP.  Check CHA or gain reputation in this settlement as a drunken lout.
12. **Involved in random brawl.**  Check STR or lose d6 HP (to a minimum of 1).
13. **Gambling binge.**   Lose all your gold, gems, jewellery.  Check WIS for each magic item in your possession: on failure, it is gone.
14. **Whisked away to Fairy.** Consult the A Night in Fairy table.
15. **Beaten and robbed.** Lose all your gold, gems, jewellery, and are reduced to half hit points.
16. **Major misunderstanding with local authorities.**  Imprisoned until fines and bribes totalling 1d6 * 1000 gold paid.  All weapons, armour, and magic items confiscated.
17. **Wake up in the forest.** GM secretly rolls to determine which adjacent hex you end up in.
18. **Get in way over your head and pray for salvation.**  God listens, and now you're under the effects of a quest spell.

### Random Events

#### Ecological

1. The Upper Hameth floods, distirbung Lake Longmere and all points northwest.
2. A forest fire rips through the wood between Dreg and Lankshorn, displacing
   Drune cottagers and revealing the Golokstone.
3. After days of loud moaning, the bicorne in 0501 attracts a mate from west of
   Kolstoke Keep.  The two start spawning offspring faster than should be
   possible.
4. The largest towering fungi around Orbswallow begin to ambulate, dragging mud
   and spores out of Mulchgrove and towards Prigwort.
5. Rain ceases to fall over the Tithelands for a month.  Castle Brackenwold and
   High Hankle slip into a supply chain crisis, and hungry out-of-work farmers
   harry trade.
6. Unseasonal snowfall blankets the central wood.  Commoners panic as they
   expect the immediate return of the Cold Prince.

#### Political

1. Toll officers and their hangers-on throw off the rule of Brackenwold and
   setup Fort Vulgar as an independent garrison town.  Extortion of local
   travellers quickly sets in and becomes a constant problem for trade.
2. Bishop Sanguine is murdered while giving a sermon in the cathedral.  Witch
   hunts run rampant in the duchy while the Church leaders squabble over power.
3. Dozens of brigands, sellswords, and rogues arrive from the Tablelands, taking
   up residence in Drigbolton and soon transforming the sleepy hamlet into a
   hive of scum and villainy rivalling Dreg.
4. Urged by his new wife, Baron Hogwarsh whips High Hankle into new heights of
   order and vigil.  Lords Ramius and Malbleat are belittled by Hogwarsh's
   authoritative push into the High Wold.  Rumors say Baroness Hogwarsh is a
   witch!
5. A freelance adventuring party, "Victorious Secret," sets up shop in Meagre's
   Reach, transforming the bizarre bumpkin village into a hub of activity,
   profit, and rumor-mongering.  Mercenary companies are frustrated by their
   success.
6. Duke Mai-Fleur's hunting party decides not to leave Dolmenwood following
   their latest visit, and declare that region of the Wood now belongs to him as
   private property.

#### Weird

1. Embala stirs in her sleep, causing dreams of giant writhing tentacles and too
   many eyes for three nights.
2. The ground shakes, wide-eyed fishermen report that Fog Lake has drained away,
   revealing an underground river (entrance to Incandescent Grottoes area 54).
   It takes a month to refill.
3. Merchants of Goblinhold begin a series of monthly night markets (in a
   pentagram arrangement) and pay with strange coins and jewels, many visitors
   disappear.
4. Time passes at a different rate in civilised lands until the New Moon, treat
   as Fairy Road time dilation when exiting.
5. Dozens of riding horses across the Wood transform into oversized black
   unicorns with hulking musculature.  They impale their handlers and nearby
   innocents, then race off to the northern forests with a keening, maniacal
   cry.
6. Following a convergence of two constellations, a wave of geomentic energy
   sweeps the wood.  A random nodal stone explodes, violently, killing the
   Audrune guardian and embedding shards of rock in the surrounding landscape
   for miles.  Drune hurry to repair it.

#### The Staff of the Apostle

A day spent doing research in a large library or church archive (eg, Harrowmoor
Keep, Castle Brackenwold) reveals the following:

- The Staff of the Apostle is a relic in the possession of the church, said to
  have the power to vanquish demons.
- It was traditionally used as part of the ritual for burning heretics at the
  stake, with the evil drawn from them (only if they repented, of course) into
  the staff, so that their souls would merely go to purgatory and not to hell.
- But witch burning has fallen out of favour these past 500 years.

Additional research with a suitable scholar or in church archives reveals:

- The staff has been missing for 500 years, and that's why witch burning has
  died off in Dolmenwood (can't do the proper ritual).
- The last burning was of all the members, including the high priestess, a woman
  with shining blue eyes, of a heretical sect which combined church doctrine
  with pagan beliefs.
- Most repented, out of fear of eternal damnation, but this high priestess was
  unrepentent to the very end, saying that her only crime was to worship the
  Gwyrigons, the three mighty archangels which God had appointed to watch over
  His creation, and that worshipping the power of God is no sin.
- (religious player characters don't know of any "three mighty archangels" or
  "Gwyrigons")

2022-06-11 --- Session 0
------------------------

### Prep

#### Session 0

1. **Premise:** cartography, everyone still happy with this?
2. **Game style:**
   - This is an OSR game: creative problem-solving is rewarded; the
     answer isn't on your character sheet; things are not balanced:
     the world is a real place, it won't all be level-appropriate, it
     will react to what you do, and to what you *don't* do.
   - It'll be very self-directed: I will provide rumours to
     investigate and NPCs to interact with, but I don't have a story
     to tell and what you engage with is up to you.
   - By default, politics will be off in the background, but if you
     want to get involved in that sort of thing there are plenty of
     factions: there's the Duke of Brackenwold, the various noble
     houses his vassals, the Church, the magical guilds, the Nag Lord,
     the rulers and wealthy families of the towns, the Drune, and you
     represent the greater authority of the Empire.
   - Much of what happens will be procedurally driven, there's rules
     for camping, fishing, foraging, weather, etc, and it's all very
     flavourful and fun.
   - Resource tracking is also going to be a big thing: when in town
     you'll need to pay for food and lodgings, and when adventuring
     you'll need to make sure you have enough food, torches,
     retainers, and any other supplies.
   - You get XP for gold, exploration, and carousing.
   - XP is divided evenly amongst surviving characters when you return
     to town, retainers who participated get a half share.
3. **Rules:**
   - PDF handouts
   - Character Creation handout
   - Optional & House Rules handout
4. **Character creation:**
   - Note: spells are learned diegetically!
   - Do this quick!
   - Mention uploads directory in file browser
5. **Logistics:**
   - Hex mapping
   - Dungeon mapping
   - Decide whether they have the player map
6. **Roll for start date.**
7. **Begin!**

#### Opening

> After making the long journey west along the King's Road, you
> arrived at Castle Brackenwold, the largest city in the region and
> capital of the duchy.  Looming over the city, built atop a hill, is
> the castle itself, surrounded by pomp and grandeur.  Around the base
> of the hill, which is called Clod's Seat, is the Inner City, the
> commercial hub of Castle Brackenwold with all its markets, courts,
> institutions of learning, the mighty Cathedral of St. Signis, and so
> on.  Finally, surrounding the Inner City in a great sprawling mass
> of teetering abodes, twisting alleyways, and seedy taverns, is the
> Outer City, home of the commonfolk of Castle Brackenwold.
>
> You've spent a few unsuccessful [weeks / days] in the city trying to
> get an audience with the Duke, or at least one of his senior
> officials, regarding the topic of mapping Dolmenwood, and any aid or
> information they can provide to that end.  It's the Empresses'
> command, after all.
>
> ...well, ok, it's not *strictly speaking* the Empresses' command,
> it's the command of the Royal Geographical Institute.  But certainly
> the Institute is highly valued by the Empress, and certainly she
> would value accurate maps of this remote border region just as
> highly, but it's not entirely accurate to say you were sent by the
> Empress herself.
>
> Or so the bureaucratic peons were quick to inform you, upon seeing
> your imperial writ.
>
> And so, now, you stand once more upon the road.  The Horse-Eye road
> which leads north-west from Castle Brackenwold to the town of
> Prigwort, a fairly central settlement within Dolmenwood itself, and
> famed for its breweries and distilleries.  "Don't be a stranger!"
> the bureaucrats said, "you're welcome to return any time!" "But
> maybe you should start your mapping, hmm?"
>
> They did at least mention that the Church would be very interested
> in knowing the locations of any old shrines you uncover, as so many
> have been lost for generations.

#### Lillibeth's observations of Drouge

- Friendly, easy to get along with
- Interested in the arcane secrets of Dolmenwood
  - Standing offer of payment for information
- Family
- Inhabitants of Bag Manor: Drouge, the servitors, the book spirit, and some
  unseen servants which ensure everything is convenient and where you want it
- Work:
  - Services & consultations
  - Gets a few customers a day, all fairly wealthy (or servants of the fairly
    wealthy) from across Dolmenwood and the surrounding area
  - Even non-humans: one evening a grimalkin comes by
  - In correspondance with more people
- One day three ducal knights arrive, middle aged woman (Sir Iris) and man (Sir
  Justus) and older man (Sir Clayton), to ask about a rogue Prismist.  Lillibeth
  is called into this meeting and questioned.  They warn to stay away from this
  Prismist, a mage who specialises in light and illusion, who could have taken
  on any form, and to report anything she discovers to them.  (prep for
  Incandescent Grottoes)

#### Researching Sir Chyde

- Can be researched in a large settlement or library (eg, Harrowmoor Keep,
  Prigwort, Castle Brackenwold)
- A day spent doing suitable research gives all the common folklore
- Every 5gp spent gives one piece of deeper information

#### Researching the Staff of the Apostle

### Prep

#### Rumours

- The Church are building a force to reclaim the Abbey of St Clewyd.
- The Duke is building a force to assault the Nagwood.

#### Drouge

- Will want to know what happened (if they tell him they don't have the ring) or
  will start to ask when they plan to go fetch it for him (if they say nothing).
- If they just try to lie and say the ring wasn't there, they'll need to
  convince him someone else stole it, since he *knows* there was a ring.
- If they tell him the truth he'll be both impressed and afraid that the barrier
  between Dolmenwood and Frigia may be coming undone.  He doesn't know how it
  works, or even that it was the Drune who set it up (though he'll be
  unsurprised to learn that, they are a likely candidate).
  - The Drune assume everyone still knows about the Triple Compact.

#### Fairy treasure

- Will need selling at a market.

- At The Breath of the Kelpie
- Upcoming:
  - 24 Iggwyld: pay retainers
  - 3 Chysting: renew room at the Clashed Antler
- 150 exploration XP

### Prep

#### Rumours

- The Order of St Signis has set up a camp at the ruined Abbey of St Clewyd.
- The Duke and the Church have founded a new military order, the Order of the
  Wood, to oppose the forces of chaos.  The Order is preparing to attack the
  crookhorns who have settled in the centre-north of the Wood, the region
  supposedly under the control of the mythical Nag Lord.

#### The Cold Prince's Mortal Agent

- Wymond Browne
- A well-dressed fat little man, wearing pince-nez glasses which he keeps
  fiddling with, middle-aged, red in the face and very sweaty.  He speaks with a
  fake-sounding posh accent, occasionally a bit of common accent slips out.
  Every few minutes he dabs his face with a purple handkerchief.
- Has tracked down the fairy gems to the Clashed Antler, and is waiting there
  for the party (i.e., whoever comes to visit that room)
  - He arrived on 20 Iggwyld, which Blino or Sespetra can tell the party
- Approaches the party, asking for news from out of town:
  - Says he's "a historian, a folklorist, an antiquarian, a lover of all things
    old, musty, fusty, and dusty"
  - Turns the conversation to the Drune, insinuates they're bad; then turns the
    conversation to the Frost Elves, insinuates they're misunderstood.
  - Carefully, but not very subtly, watching everyone's reactions.
  - If directly confronted, says "Well, we don't really know what the Frost
    Elves were like, do we?  All we have are old stories which make out the
    Drune, of all people, to be the heroes of the day.  I am interested in the
    truth."
  - If he thinks the party may be swayable to the Cold Prince (or at least,
    against the Drune), says he's interested in the comings and goings of the
    Drune, slides across a fancy-looking silver coin (10gp), and says he can be
    found at Raptappen's Quadrant, and leaves.

        - Drune say they'll return next full moon, and leave

        - The Drune say they do this to protect the village
        - He was told about this, and sworn into secrecy, by the previous
          Headman
        - As far as he knows, this has been going on for centuries
        - He doesn't know if the Drune are telling the truth, and suspects their
          motives, but doesn't want to risk endangering the village.

<aside class="highlight">This was a 1-on-1 Lillibeth focussed session.</aside>

### Intro

- Session recap
- Talk about the Drune, the Triple Compact, the Cold Prince, etc

### State

- 22 Iggwyld (afternoon): clement, cheery
- Lillibeth in 0505, facing 4 Drune cottagers, her back to a cliff

### Prep

- Outline:
  - Lillibeth is disarmed and magicked (Detect Magic & Detect Illusion)
  - Lillibeth is taken to the Drune cottage
  - Lillibeth is interrogated
    - Only Limnis and his family live on the island, the rest converged from
      elsewhere in the hex when they saw Lillibeth flying in
  3. Made to stay until Drunemoot on the night of the 24th
     - Told that if she flees the island, her and the party will be considered
       agents of the Cold Prince and hunted down.
     - Deregbra will be intensely interested in her and monopolise her time if
       possible
     - Deregbra very proudly introduces her to Darren, her secret boyfriend from
       Fort Vulgar, he's a *fisherman*('s son)---isn't that *wonderful?*
  4. Be taken to Drunemoot
- Drune characteristics:
  - Very pale
  - Hair is straight and black
  - Tall

#### Drune cottage

- A quaint little cottage with a little vegetable garden, in a clearing
  Lillibeth is sure wasn't there before
- Kilnling turns its clay head and stares at Lillibeth as she approaches
- Limnis (cottager), Polldra (drunewife), Deregbra (braithmaid), 4 other
  children (run from Lillibeth and watch her from a safe distance)

#### Interrogation

- **What they want to know:**
  - Who Lillibeth is
  - How she got there
  - What she knows
  - Whether she is an agent of the Cold Prince
- **What they know:**
  - That the barrier at Sir Chyde's tomb was weak
  - That Lillibeth came soaring through the air towards Hoarblight Keep
  - The descriptions of the party at the Gorthstone (from Haygral's
    description)---and they will connect that with Lillibeth if she mentions
    being from Prigwort, the Gorthstone, Sir Chyde's sword, the fight, etc
- **What they don't know:**
  - That Sir Chyde's ghost gave the party his sword (though the sword is still
    the property of the Drune in their eyes)
  - That the barrier at Sir Chyde's tomb had weakened enough to allow mortals to
    pass through
  - That the barrier at Sir Chyde's tomb has now repaired itself
- **What they assume:**
  - That Lillibeth is at best a meddler planning to rob Hoarblight Keep of its
    fairy treasures and at worst an agent of the Cold Prince working to restore
    him---especially so if they realise Lillibeth is one of those tresspassing
    murderers

#### Drunemoot

- About a dozen Drune present
- Cadfan of the Aegis presiding
- A misunderstanding is no excuse for murder and tresspass, but the party have
  the opportunity to prove their honesty and make amends by assisting the
  Drune---without asking unnecessary questions:
  - Bring them a man from Prigwort who has been paying people in fairy coinage
    and ice jewels for information about the Drune.
  - This is only the first task.
  - They will be watching.

### Notes

        don't tell anyone I told you that, it's a secret!"

        to ask dad, but he wouldn't tell you"
      - Says that the Audrunes watch over the ley lines
    - Drunemoot:
      - Cadfan says the party are likely not agents of the Cold Prince working
        towards his restoration, and so have an opportunity to prove that and
        that the whole thing was a big misunderstanding: if they assist the
        Drune with an unspecified number of tasks.
