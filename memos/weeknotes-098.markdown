## Work

I'm still trying to get the hang of figuring out how much technical
work will get done in a sprint, I find I over- or under-estimate it
every time.  Though, we're not *really* working in sprints, in that
the end of a sprint isn't anything significant at all---we're not
shipping a new version, giving a demo, or anything like that---it just
marks when our regular planning meeting is.  At least for the
development work.  User research and design work do seem to be moving
on a much more regular cadence.

I find my natural approach to technical work is more like kanban,
where there's a roughly prioritised backlog which people just pull
work from when they need a new task.  I'm yet to be really convinced
of the benefit of sprints.

In terms of what we actually worked on this week, that's perhaps not
too exciting without knowing details which I can't share yet.  But I
hope I'll be able to reveal more concrete information (and start
linking to GitHub repositories) some time this month.  No promises
though.


## Books

This week I read:

- [Deadhouse Gates][] by Steven Erikson, the second of the Malazan
  Book of the Fallen series.  It was good, definitely had better
  characterisation than the first book, but it wasn't quite to the
  point of it being like it had been written by a different person, as
  some have described the difference.

- [The Atlas of the Land][] by Karen Wynn Fonstad, a map of the places
  of Stephen R. Donaldson's [The Chronicles of Thomas Covenant][].
  I'd had this one on the go for a couple of months.  Despite being
  under 200 pages, I found it hard to sit and concentrate on the maps
  and descriptions.  I've discovered I really like this sort of
  worldbuilding in a story, but by itself it's just a bit too dry.

  It also reminded me of the inconsistency in worldbuilding between
  the first two chronicles.  In the first, The Land is the only place
  really talked about, with almost no mention of places over the sea
  (just the ancestral homeland of the giants, I think), and The Land
  is portrayed as the spiritual centre of the world: it's where the
  evil overlord is, after all, and the wise lords who oppose him.
  Overseas trade never comes up.  The only foreigners---the
  Haruchai---are from a different country on the same landmass.  But
  then in the second chronicles we discover that The Land is really
  just one small part of the world, that there are other nations, and
  they have extensive sea trade networks.  It's not just the giants
  who traverse the oceans, it's men too.  So why is The Land totally
  disconnected from this global network?

- Volume 12 of [Overlord][] by Kugane Maruyama, which finally arrived
  this week.  God knows when volume 13 will be available; the English
  releases seem to be lagging about 3 years behind the Japanese, so
  maybe late next year some time.
