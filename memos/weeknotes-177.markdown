## Work

Well, there goes my last full week at GDS.  I think I've worked
through all the mandatory leaving-related admin tasks now, and I
finished off all work that I had in progress.

I'm not expecting much to get done in the two and a half days next
week I have left.


## Books

This week I read:

- [Deadhouse Gates][] by Steven Erikson, the second of the [Malazan Book of the Fallen][].

  When I first read this, [in August 2020][], I didn't think it felt
  so different to [Gardens of the Moon][].  But, now that I've
  finished the series as a whole and have started re-reading it, I can
  see that Deadhouse Gates is much more like the following books than
  Gardens of the Moon is.

  This is still one of my favourite books in the series.  The chain of
  dogs, wherein a large-scale uprising forces a military commander and
  his army to guard and guide tens of thousands of refugees across
  hundreds of leagues of wasteland and desert, having to fend off
  attacks almost daily for months on end, slowly losing supplies,
  people, and will, is a great story.

## Gaming

I had an idle thought about timescales in tabletop RPG campaigns.
Garry Gygax once famously said:

> You can not have a meaningful campaign if strict time records are
> not kept.

Which is a bit weird on the face of it.  I'd hazard a guess that in
*most* campaigns, time is somewhat fuzzy.  And yet, looking back at my
two recent campaigns, I think it holds true.

Ars Magica lasted years of in-game time.  But that didn't really feel
very significant.  Yes, a lot of time passed, but it didn't feel like
the characters significantly changed over that time.  Nor did the
players really get much done: things just take a long time (typically
multiple seasons) in Ars Magica, so a single large project might take
years of work.

Whereas in Traveller, we're approaching one year of in-game time.
This is much less than in Ars Magica, but it actually feels much more
significant.  It both feels like a lot has happened, *and* that it's
happened at a reasonable pace.

I think they key difference is that a week is a much more human-scale
period of time, at least to me.  I can look back at my notes and think
"ah yes, this week they spent a few days at the starport looking for
cargo and passengers, and then they spent three days flying to the gas
giant to refuel".  That feels sensible and reasonable.  Whereas in Ars
Magica, it's more like "ok, so this character spent three whole months
studying this one book", the time is so long that it all kind of blurs
together.

I've also noticed that the Traveller sessions which feel least
satisfying to me tend to be the ones where I get fuzzy with time, and
don't work out how long things actually took until when I'm writing up
my notes after the session ends.  Then sometimes I'll realise that
three months have passed and they should have been doing ship
maintenance or paying their crew's salaries, and we have to catch up
with those admin tasks at the start of the next session.
