## Work

It's been a quiet week.  I was still on support for Monday and
Tuesday, which was fairly relaxing (makes a nice change).  After that
I deleted one bunch of code, and rewrote another bunch.


## The Plague

Last week I managed to buy flour.  This week I did not.  Was it only a
dream?


## Miscellaneous

### Books

This week I read [Tau Zero][] by Poul Anderson, it's about a bunch of
scientists on a mission to another planet, but their ship is damaged
and they can't slow down.  So they end up travelling space, slowly
succumbing to despair and madness... but there is a happy ending after
all.

### Games

Apocalypse World and Golden Sky Stories this week.  There was a good
moment in Apocalypse World where all the players had figured out a
sinister mystery... then someone said "hang on, have any of the
*characters* been in enough scenes to know what's going on?"

"Don't split the party" is a piece of commonly-given GM advice but, in
this game, there have only been three or four times when all the PCs
were together.  And it seems to be working well.

I started writing up my Golden Sky Stories [session notes][].
