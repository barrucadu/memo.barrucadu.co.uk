## Work

This week was *supposed* to be about taking it easy and doing some
team stuff, before getting back into the project proper next week, but
I ended up using scraps of spare time here and there to completely
rewrite our prototype, changing a core assumption.

Though it was nice to be able to spend multiple days getting stuck
into something which might have gone nowhere and been thrown away.
We've been in a "discovery" for the past 6 weeks, so I suppose
technically that's always been the case; but it's certainly easier to
just do random exploratory work when you don't need to think about
writing up cards or even how you work is going to fit in with others.

I think going forward I'll try to write more exploratory cards, as
we've had a lot of fairly concrete ones.


## Books

This week I read:

- [The Ritual][], by Adam Nevill.

  There's a recent film of the same name, which I saw first.  They're
  both very good, though the second half of the book and film are
  pretty different.  The book has a pretty significant shift in tone
  (though still remaining horror).  I think the film probably made the
  right choice in changing it, I'm not sure the second half of the
  book would have worked as well in the more limited time available on
  screen as it did in the book.

## Games

My [Call of Cthulhu game][] reached the thrilling conclusion of the
current story arc: the investigators ventured to Costa Rica and then
Canada to find the two magical crystals keeping Gla'aki imprisoned on
Earth.  They disabled one crystal, Gla'aki mind-controlled an unwary
investigator and made them disable the second, and Gla'aki returned to
space.

With [a few unforeseen consequences][].

Next session we're going to switch to the [Pulp Cthulhu][] rules and
play the Peru chapter of [Masks of Nyarlathotep][] (MoN).  [I have run
MoN before][], but not with the pulp rules, and also this time we're
not necessarily committing to the whole campaign, for now we're just
doing the prequel.  One of the investigators owes Nyarlathotep "a
moment of their time", so I'm looking forward to that coming up at a
suitably dramatic moment.

Overall I think this story arc went well.  None of the three players
had played Call of Cthulhu before, but they picked up the rules pretty
easily and enjoyed the game.  I did float the idea of changing game
systems if people had had enough of Call of Cthulhu now, but no, they
wanted to continue.
