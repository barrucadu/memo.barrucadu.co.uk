<aside class="highlight">This campaign is ongoing and this memo contains spoilers.</aside>


Overview
--------

The game has to support new players with no previous RPG experience,
and to support an essentially arbitrary cast of players and characters
each session.  This is because there's a lot of people interested,
many of whom are totally new.

I'm approaching this by running a very plot-directed
adventuring-focussed game, with little downtime between adventures.

**Golden rule #1:** do not start a session with downtime, get straight
to the action to keep new players hooked.

**Golden rule #2:** require as little mechanical knowledge as
possible, to lower the barrier to entry.

### Structure

I've decided to use the [5 room
dungeon](https://www.roleplayingtips.com/5-room-dungeons/) structure, aiming to
take 2 or 3 sessions per step, which will make the campaign take around 6 months
(fortnightly sessions skipping the occasional one).  A long or complex plot
won't work, it'll simply take too much time and people will forget the details.

1. **Entrance and Guardian.** The players learn that frost elves are real and
   that there are connections between the mortal world and Frigia (Winter's
   Daughter).

2. **Puzzle or Roleplaying Challenge.** The players are sent to Azeria, to ask
   about the state of the barrier (since she doesn't get on with the wizard).
   Azeria tells them that the barrier is indeed weakening, and that there's an
   undercover frost elf who has been studying it in great detail (the ice
   tower): but the players arrive to find the research materials gone, only a
   teleportation circle remaining.

3. **Trick or Setback.** The players have to destroy the research materials
   (between adventures Wulfred or one of the PC magic-users can analyse the
   teleportation circle to work out where they were sent) and, in the process,
   learn that the barrier is weakening because of an ancient artefact of the
   Cold Prince, left behind in Hoarblight Keep and poisoning the magic.

4. **Climax, Big Battle, or Conflict.** The players have to sneak into the ruins
   of Hoarblight Keep, dealing with twisted demi-fey, and perform the ritual to
   end the last vestiges of the Cold Prince's power in the mortal world, ending
   the disruption to the barrier so that it will no longer continue to weaken
   (some sort of dungeon).

6. **Reward, Revelation, Plot Twist.** The players are told that they have to
   return the ring to Frigia, to seal the remaining breach.  They return to Sir
   Chyde's tomb to find it enased in ice, have to fight their way through to the
   portal, and have a final battle against Lord Mantle-of-Runes on the other
   side while the breach seals behind them.
   
   If they defeat Lord Mantle-of-Runes:
   
   - Before the gate closes: they get out, it's a total success, good ending.
   - After the gate closes: they saved the world but are trapped in Fairy,
     set-up for another campaign.
   
   If they don't defeat Lord Mantle-of-Runes:
   
   - They brought the ring back to they saved the world, a bittersweet ending as
     he realises he's still trapped.
 
To keep things even simpler, I'm dropping XP: characters will level up
automatically when they complete a phase.


2022-08-03 --- 1: Winter's Daughter 1
-------------------------------------

### Prep

#### Session 0

- Character creation
- Discussion points:
  - People's previous RPG experience
  - We're playing OSE, which is based on an older and simpler edition
    of D&D
  - Describe what you’re doing, don’t just ask to roll
  - Think creatively, it's not a video game or board game
  - Be cautious, 1st level characters are flimsy

#### Opening

> You have all been hired by a wizard to go to a centuries-old burial
> mound and retrieve for him a ring that was buried with the occupant.
> A bronze band set with a moonstone, with fittings in the form of
> woven branches.  He said he doesn't know who was buried there, but
> that his magical researches have led him to become aware of this
> ring.  And as for why he's interested in the ring, well, he said
> that all you really need to know is that he’s sufficiently
> interested in it to pay you 5,000 gold pieces to fetch it, which is
> quite a good sum of money.
>
> So, you journeyed through the forest all of yesterday, camped for
> the night, and got up well rested this morning for your assault on
> the burial mound.  You can see ahead of you the trees open up, into
> what looks like a clearing, and there’s a very overgrown path
> heading in.  In the clearing you see the mound: a large flat-topped
> hillock, clearly artificial.  And you can hear, coming from along
> the path, towards the mound, the quiet sound of clanking metal.
>
> What do you do?

### Notes

- Throw rocks at iron owls
- Move granite slab
- Explore tomb:
  - Figure out they need two dog names
  - Find "CHEDR" on mural
  - Did not examine tapestry
  - Found portal to Fairy

### Next time

- Winter's Daughter
- Hook for next adventure


2022-08-16 --- 1: Winter's Daughter 2
-------------------------------------

### Intro

- Character creation
- Session recap

### Prep

#### Frigia

- Creep up the forest:
  - The gently falling snow and tall pine trees blanket all sound
  - It's dim and grey, with sunlight filtering through the clouds
  - There's no landmarks other than the path
  - Run as the Prince's Road: except that the portal comes out into
    the middle of it, with no indication of which direction to go
    (whichever they pick will be the right way)

- Play the frost elves as over-the-top anime characters:
  - Knights are big and muscular, engaging in feats of strength like
    arm wrestling competitions and lifting occupied benches
  - Nobles are incredibly pompous, wearing over-the-top clothes, and
    considering everyone other than other frost elves worse than trash
  - Returning to the mortal world is their driving obsession, they
    won't willingly part with any mortals who come into their grasp.
  - They look creepy: tall, slightly too thin, faces slightly too
    pointed, fingers are too delicate and have too many joints, limbs
    are too long.  Their faces and eyes are pale.

#### Next adventure hook

- Sir Chyde and Princess Snowfall-at-Dusk will comment that the
  fissure is new:
  - Could indicate the barriers between Frigia and the mortal world
    are weakening
  - Bringing the ring to Frigia will close it, but something's not
    right
  - The mortal world is in danger, this must be dealt with (but, alas,
    they cannot do so themselves being of Fairy!)

- The wizard (a sketchy apprentice of Mostlemyre's) will question them
  and set up a meeting with the Drune, the Church, and he and his
  master, to discuss the threat
  - It's due to the Nag Lord poisoning the wood
  - Play up the factional conflict at this meeting
  - Slip in a "fellowship of the ring" joke if possible
  - Next step is to go to the Frost Elf embassy out west and try to
    learn if they're working with the Nag Lord, or if this is just his
    mischief

### Notes

- Met the ghost of Sir Chyde and heard his story (900 years, forbidden
  love, Cold Prince, etc)
- Returned the ring to the princess
- Told the frost elves that you were mortals
- Lord Mantle-of-Runes, commander of the armies of the Cold Prince,
  was summoned to interrogate the mortals, but they wished their way
  out of Frigia by then
- Back in the mortal world with the ring
- Portal in Sir Chyde's tomb is still active

### Next time

- XP & levelling up
- Lore for Lord Mantle-of-Runes & the war against the Cold Prince
- Meeting the wizard
- Next adventure


2022-09-07 --- 1: A Geomantic Aside
-----------------------------------

### Intro

- Character creation
- Revisit session 0 points (new players)

### Prep

> You two were hired caravan guards, who have escorted your employers, a couple
> of merchants, to the town of Castle Brackenwold.  It's a large bustling town
> of about 9000 inhabitants, it's the capital of the Duchy of Brackenwold, which
> is this whole area, it's the home of the Duke himself, also it's also the
> local centre of religion, having a cathedral and being the home of the Bishop,
> it also has chapters of the College of Sorcerers and the Guild of
> Enchanters...  it's an important place, with a lot of stuff going on!  You've
> been here a few days now, mostly killing time in the local taverns, getting to
> know the locals and looking for your next job.
>
> You're strangers to the area so you don't really know the situation here, but
> you've heard that the Dolmenwood, which is the vast forest to the north and
> west is a fairly wild and dangerous place.  Outside the towns and off the
> roads, all manner of fey creatures and strange people are said to dwell, most
> god-fearing folk don't venture far from civilisation.
>
> Just as your coin started to run out, your fortune turned.  You encountered a
> local wizard called Wulfred, who has hired you to look into "a couple of sites
> of geographic interest", is how he put it.  He is paying you, 10% up front,
> the rest on completion, 500gp, to investigate two standing stones.  One just
> to the west of Castle Brackenwold in hex 1308, and one to the north-east of
> the town of Prigwort in hex 1205.  He himself is returning to Prigwort, and
> says to inquire there at an inn called the Clashed Antler for the rest of your
> payment when done.  He's also said he may pay extra for any interesting
> discoveries, so be sure to be thorough.  He was kind of nonspecific on what
> sort of interesting things you might find, and also 500gp is a *lot* of money
> just to check out some rocks, so there may be more going on here than meets
> the eye, but, well, you need a job.
>
> And so, on the morning of the 27th of Chysting, a summer's day, you set off.
> Now, can someone roll `2d6` to determine the weather?

- **Wulfred, 4th level magic-user**
  - A thin man in his late 30s, balding, dresses like a stereotypical wizard as
    if he wants to make sure everyone knows that's what he is.  Apprenticed to
    Mostlemyre Drouge.
  - **Demeanour:** Irritable, brash, considers himself better than most people.
  - **Speech:** Nasal, abrupt.  Woldish, Old Woldish.
  - **Desires:** Spells, tomes, and magic items.  Fame and respect.
  - **Possessions:** A ruby *ring of protection*, ley-line sensing pendulum.
    Spells: *Detect Magic*, *Read Magic*, *Continual Light*, *Mirror Image*.

2022-10-05 --- 2: The Fox and the Drune
---------------------------------------

### Intro

- Campaign structure note:
  - I've decided to condense things: 2.5 hours twice a month isn't suitable for
    a long or complex campaign
  - We're using milestone levelling now
  - Each arc will be 1 to 3 sessions
  - I have a rough plan up to level 6, and that will be the end of the campaign
- Level up!
  - Hand out character sheets
  - Roll HP:
    - Carmen: `2 + 1d4`
    - Gratrix: `3 + 1d4`
    - Marceline: `5 + 1d4 + 1`
    - Marlow: `8 + 1d8 + 1`
    - Rakno: `7 + 1d8 + 1`
    - Selindra: `6 + 1d6 - 1`
- Show party treasure sheet

> Our story so far is that Carmen, Gratrix, Marceline, Marlow, and Selindra were
> sent by a sketchy wizard to fetch a ring from a burial mound.  You found that
> the mound was actually the tomb of a famous knight, called Sir Chyde, who,
> according to legend, fought against the frost elves and their evil leader the
> Cold Prince, to free the forest from unnatural winter.  And what's more, you
> met Sir Chyde himself, in ghostly form.  His soul was bound to his ring, the
> very ring that the wizard wanted you to fetch, he was unable to rest and was
> waiting and hoping to be reunited with his love, a fairy princess, a daughter
> of the Cold Prince, the Princess Snowfall-at-Dusk.
>
> You agreed to his request, like the good people you are, and took his ring
> through a portal to Frigia, realm of the frost elves.  You gave the ring to
> the Princess, reuniting her and Sir Chyde, and it was almost perfect.  But not
> quite, you aroused the curiosity of the frost elves, and let slip that you
> were, indeed, from the mortal world.  Something they found very interesting,
> as all paths between Frigia and the mortal world are supposed to be magically
> sealed, and have been since the Cold Prince's defeat 800 years ago.  They
> called for a fearsome fairy noble, Lord Mantle-of-Runes, commander of the
> armies of the Cold Prince, to interrogate you and learn the way back.  But
> before he could arrive, Princess Snowfall-at-Dusk granted you a wish, as
> thanks for reuniting her and her love.  You wished to be back outside the
> burial mound, with an exact copy of Sir Chyde's ring, so that you could hand
> it into the wizard and collect your pay.
>
> Now, Rakno here, is a young squire.  He set off from his home town in search
> of noble deeds to do and quests to complete, to prove his name, as squires are
> wont to do.  But he ended up in a tavern in the largest town of the region,
> running low on cash, and with no noble deeds to his name.  Then, a wizard
> arrived.  A slightly sketchy-looking fellow, who hired Rakno to go check out
> some local standing stones.  Rakno agreed, and set off into the forest, on a
> warm summer's day.
>
> After an unfortunate zombie-related situation, Rakno came upon two pillars of
> ice, unmelting beneath the summer heat, with a wall of mist between them.
> This was clearly the standing stones.  Stepping through the mist, Rakno found
> himself in a cold place, on a road of ice, high up in some mountains, with a
> blizzard blowing about him.  Walking along the road, Rakno came upon a man,
> frozen beneath the surface of the road, and decided that this was a bit much
> for a lone squire, and turned back.  Later he learned that somehow, despite
> being on the road for only a few hours, 6 days had passed.
>
> I'm sure you've put two and two together, but it was indeed the same sketchy
> wizard in both cases.  And now, the whole party is united, you've been brought
> together by the wizard for another job.
>
> A week or so has passed since you finished your first jobs, the wizard did
> manage to get the full stories out of all of you and was pretty concerned that
> you guys were able to simply walk into Frigia and talk to frost elves, and
> that Rakno had no difficulty with the road.  He said that perhaps the barrier
> which keeps Frigia away and the frost elves out is weakening, it's been in
> place for centuries after all, and such vast magic is difficult to control.
> Unfortunately, he has no idea who made the barrier, what powers it, how it
> works, or how to repair it.  But he knows someone who might!  Unfortunately,
> he can't go talk to this person himself due to, let's just say a personality
> clash.
>
> So, it is a mild summer's afternoon, you are all on the road which leads
> through the forest, but you are facing off the road: you're facing into the
> forest to the north-east, where apparently a very old and wise and
> knowledgeable person called Azeria makes her home.  The wizard said she lives
> in a house-sized clearing and you can recognise it because the ground is a
> large old mosaic, built by some previous inhabitant of the wood.
>
> What do you do?

### State

- In 1307, early afternoon

### Prep

#### Azeria (1406)

- [The Golden Wood](campaign-notes-2022-06-cartographic-curiosities/1406-the-golden-wood.pdf)
- Azeria tells them:
  - That the barrier is weakening, by itself slowly
  - But that there's also an undercover frost elf working to bring the barrier
    down more rapidly
  - Azeria will tell where that elf is if they "deal with" (intentionally vague)
    "that annoying druid, Majorus, who lives in a cottage nearby"
  - The undercover frost elf is Lady Misthraine at the Tower of Frost in hex
    1007
- If they're hostile to Majorus, play up the sinisterness: no nice old woman and
  friendly teenage daughter.

#### Lady Misthraine (1007)

- As described
- The Lady is home
- On the 2nd floor, there's magical paraphernalia: a compass which follows ley
  lines, a barometer to measure ambient magic, common components
- And also on workbench a short-range teleportation circle (somewhere within
  Dolmenwood) with trace magic showing recent use, and also a cut off bit of
  note-paper next to it (some paper was teleported while being partially out of
  the circle): a fragment of notes on the barrier, she has sent her work
  elsewhere.

### Notes

- **Drune Cottage:**
  - Meet Estembra and Majorus (realise too late they're in the wrong place)
  - Mention frost elves but refuse to tell the details, Majorus says the gates should be closed
  - Get history from Majorus
  - Majorus charms Selindra to question her
  - Marceline sleeps Majorus
  - Get Estembra to take them to Azeria's clearing
- **Azeria's Clearing:**
  - Barrier is weakening
  - There's a frost elf working to undermine it
  - Azeria will say where that elf is if they "deal with" Majorus and Estembra
  - Sign a contract witnessed by Woteus, god of truth
  - Discuss what to do as they head back to the cottage

### Next time

- Drune cottage
- Level up Carmen and Gratrix


2022-10-18 --- 2: The Drune and the Elf
---------------------------------------

### Intro

- Session recap

### State

- Carmen and Gratrix need to level up
- In 1406, evening

### Prep

- **Azeria:**
  - Will uphold the bargain, she's not trying to trick the PCs
- **Majorus:**
  - Is unwilling to leave, but could be convinced, eg:
    - If they take him with them
    - If they agree to subject themselves to questioning after the mission
    - If they beat him up sufficiently to prove they could just kill him if need
      be
  - Knows that Azeria is truthful, and that plus a description of the contract
    signing will convince him there is a genuine elf situation
  - Wants to capture the PCs and hand them over to the Aegis for questioning
- **Lady Misthraine:**
  - Is as described
