Overview
--------

The game has to support new players with no previous RPG experience,
and to support an essentially arbitrary cast of players and characters
each session.  This is because there's a lot of people interested,
many of whom are totally new.

I'm approaching this by running a very plot-directed
adventuring-focussed game, with little downtime between adventures.

**Golden rule #1:** do not start a session with downtime, get straight
to the action to keep new players hooked.

**Golden rule #2:** require as little mechanical knowledge as
possible, to lower the barrier to entry.

----------------------------------

### Prep

#### Session 0

- Character creation
- Discussion points:
  - People's previous RPG experience
  - We're playing OSE, which is based on an older and simpler edition
    of D&D
  - Describe what you’re doing, don’t just ask to roll
  - Think creatively, it's not a video game or board game
  - Be cautious, 1st level characters are flimsy

#### Opening

> You have all been hired by a wizard to go to a centuries-old burial
> mound and retrieve for him a ring that was buried with the occupant.
> A bronze band set with a moonstone, with fittings in the form of
> woven branches.  He said he doesn't know who was buried there, but
> that his magical researches have led him to become aware of this
> ring.  And as for why he's interested in the ring, well, he said
> that all you really need to know is that he’s sufficiently
> interested in it to pay you 5,000 gold pieces to fetch it, which is
> quite a good sum of money.
>
> So, you journeyed through the forest all of yesterday, camped for
> the night, and got up well rested this morning for your assault on
> the burial mound.  You can see ahead of you the trees open up, into
> what looks like a clearing, and there’s a very overgrown path
> heading in.  In the clearing you see the mound: a large flat-topped
> hillock, clearly artificial.  And you can hear, coming from along
> the path, towards the mound, the quiet sound of clanking metal.
>
> What do you do?

2022-08-16 --- Winter's Daughter 2
----------------------------------

### Intro

- Character creation
- Session recap

### Prep

#### Frigia

- Creep up the forest:
  - The gently falling snow and tall pine trees blanket all sound
  - It's dim and grey, with sunlight filtering through the clouds
  - There's no landmarks other than the path
  - Run as the Prince's Road: except that the portal comes out into
    the middle of it, with no indication of which direction to go
    (whichever they pick will be the right way)

- Play the frost elves as over-the-top anime characters:
  - Knights are big and muscular, engaging in feats of strength like
    arm wrestling competitions and lifting occupied benches
  - Nobles are incredibly pompous, wearing over-the-top clothes, and
    considering everyone other than other frost elves worse than trash
  - Returning to the mortal world is their driving obsession, they
    won't willingly part with any mortals who come into their grasp.
  - They look creepy: tall, slightly too thin, faces slightly too
    pointed, fingers are too delicate and have too many joints, limbs
    are too long.  Their faces and eyes are pale.

#### Next adventure hook

- Sir Chyde and Princess Snowfall-at-Dusk will comment that the
  fissure is new:
  - Could indicate the barriers between Frigia and the mortal world
    are weakening
  - Bringing the ring to Frigia will close it, but something's not
    right
  - The mortal world is in danger, this must be dealt with (but, alas,
    they cannot do so themselves being of Fairy!)

- The wizard (a sketchy apprentice of Mostlemyre's) will question them
  and set up a meeting with the Drune, the Church, and he and his
  master, to discuss the threat
  - It's due to the Nag Lord poisoning the wood
  - Play up the factional conflict at this meeting
  - Slip in a "fellowship of the ring" joke if possible
  - Next step is to go to the Frost Elf embassy out west and try to
    learn if they're working with the Nag Lord, or if this is just his
    mischief

### Notes

- Met the ghost of Sir Chyde and heard his story (900 years, forbidden
  love, Cold Prince, etc)
- Returned the ring to the princess
- Told the frost elves that you were mortals
- Lord Mantle-of-Runes, commander of the armies of the Cold Prince,
  was summoned to interrogate the mortals, but they wished their way
  out of Frigia by then
- Back in the mortal world with the ring
- Portal in Sir Chyde's tomb is still active

### Next time

- Lore for Lord Mantle-of-Runes & the war against the Cold Prince
- Meeting the wizard
- Next adventure
