<aside class="highlight">This campaign is ongoing and this memo contains spoilers.</aside>

Overview
--------

The game has to support new players with no previous RPG experience,
and to support an essentially arbitrary cast of players and characters
each session.  This is because there's a lot of people interested,
many of whom are totally new.

I'm approaching this by running a very plot-directed
adventuring-focussed game, with little downtime between adventures.

**Golden rule #1:** do not start a session with downtime, get straight
to the action to keep new players hooked.

**Golden rule #2:** require as little mechanical knowledge as
possible, to lower the barrier to entry.


2022-08-03 --- Winter's Daughter 1
----------------------------------

### Prep

#### Session 0

- Character creation
- Discussion points:
  - People's previous RPG experience
  - We're playing OSE, which is based on an older and simpler edition
    of D&D
  - Describe what you’re doing, don’t just ask to roll
  - Think creatively, it's not a video game or board game
  - Be cautious, 1st level characters are flimsy

#### Opening

> You have all been hired by a wizard to go to a centuries-old burial
> mound and retrieve for him a ring that was buried with the occupant.
> A bronze band set with a moonstone, with fittings in the form of
> woven branches.  He said he doesn't know who was buried there, but
> that his magical researches have led him to become aware of this
> ring.  And as for why he's interested in the ring, well, he said
> that all you really need to know is that he’s sufficiently
> interested in it to pay you 5,000 gold pieces to fetch it, which is
> quite a good sum of money.
>
> So, you journeyed through the forest all of yesterday, camped for
> the night, and got up well rested this morning for your assault on
> the burial mound.  You can see ahead of you the trees open up, into
> what looks like a clearing, and there’s a very overgrown path
> heading in.  In the clearing you see the mound: a large flat-topped
> hillock, clearly artificial.  And you can hear, coming from along
> the path, towards the mound, the quiet sound of clanking metal.
>
> What do you do?

### Notes

- Throw rocks at iron owls
- Move granite slab
- Explore tomb:
  - Figure out they need two dog names
  - Find "CHEDR" on mural
  - Did not examine tapestry
  - Found portal to Fairy

### Next time

- Winter's Daughter
- Hook for next adventure


2022-08-16 --- Winter's Daughter 2
----------------------------------

### Intro

- Character creation
- Session recap

### Prep

#### Frigia

- Creep up the forest:
  - The gently falling snow and tall pine trees blanket all sound
  - It's dim and grey, with sunlight filtering through the clouds
  - There's no landmarks other than the path
  - Run as the Prince's Road: except that the portal comes out into
    the middle of it, with no indication of which direction to go
    (whichever they pick will be the right way)

- Play the frost elves as over-the-top anime characters:
  - Knights are big and muscular, engaging in feats of strength like
    arm wrestling competitions and lifting occupied benches
  - Nobles are incredibly pompous, wearing over-the-top clothes, and
    considering everyone other than other frost elves worse than trash
  - Returning to the mortal world is their driving obsession, they
    won't willingly part with any mortals who come into their grasp.
  - They look creepy: tall, slightly too thin, faces slightly too
    pointed, fingers are too delicate and have too many joints, limbs
    are too long.  Their faces and eyes are pale.

#### Next adventure hook

- Sir Chyde and Princess Snowfall-at-Dusk will comment that the
  fissure is new:
  - Could indicate the barriers between Frigia and the mortal world
    are weakening
  - Bringing the ring to Frigia will close it, but something's not
    right
  - The mortal world is in danger, this must be dealt with (but, alas,
    they cannot do so themselves being of Fairy!)

- The wizard (a sketchy apprentice of Mostlemyre's) will question them
  and set up a meeting with the Drune, the Church, and he and his
  master, to discuss the threat
  - It's due to the Nag Lord poisoning the wood
  - Play up the factional conflict at this meeting
  - Slip in a "fellowship of the ring" joke if possible
  - Next step is to go to the Frost Elf embassy out west and try to
    learn if they're working with the Nag Lord, or if this is just his
    mischief

### Notes

- Met the ghost of Sir Chyde and heard his story (900 years, forbidden
  love, Cold Prince, etc)
- Returned the ring to the princess
- Told the frost elves that you were mortals
- Lord Mantle-of-Runes, commander of the armies of the Cold Prince,
  was summoned to interrogate the mortals, but they wished their way
  out of Frigia by then
- Back in the mortal world with the ring
- Portal in Sir Chyde's tomb is still active

### Next time

- XP & levelling up
- Lore for Lord Mantle-of-Runes & the war against the Cold Prince
- Meeting the wizard
- Next adventure


2022-09-07 --- Rakno Rising
---------------------------

### Intro

- Character creation
- Revisit session 0 points (new players)

### Prep

> You two were hired caravan guards, who have escorted your employers, a couple
> of merchants, to the town of Castle Brackenwold.  It's a large bustling town
> of about 9000 inhabitants, it's the capital of the Duchy of Brackenwold, which
> is this whole area, it's the home of the Duke himself, also it's also the
> local centre of religion, having a cathedral and being the home of the Bishop,
> it also has chapters of the College of Sorcerers and the Guild of
> Enchanters...  it's an important place, with a lot of stuff going on!  You've
> been here a few days now, mostly killing time in the local taverns, getting to
> know the locals and looking for your next job.
>
> You're strangers to the area so you don't really know the situation here, but
> you've heard that the Dolmenwood, which is the vast forest to the north and
> west is a fairly wild and dangerous place.  Outside the towns and off the
> roads, all manner of fey creatures and strange people are said to dwell, most
> god-fearing folk don't venture far from civilisation.
>
> Just as your coin started to run out, your fortune turned.  You encountered a
> local wizard called Wulfred, who has hired you to look into "a couple of sites
> of geographic interest", is how he put it.  He is paying you, 10% up front,
> the rest on completion, 500gp, to investigate two standing stones.  One just
> to the west of Castle Brackenwold in hex 1308, and one to the north-east of
> the town of Prigwort in hex 1205.  He himself is returning to Prigwort, and
> says to inquire there at an inn called the Clashed Antler for the rest of your
> payment when done.  He's also said he may pay extra for any interesting
> discoveries, so be sure to be thorough.  He was kind of nonspecific on what
> sort of interesting things you might find, and also 500gp is a *lot* of money
> just to check out some rocks, so there may be more going on here than meets
> the eye, but, well, you need a job.
>
> And so, on the morning of the 27th of Chysting, a summer's day, you set off.
> Now, can someone roll `2d6` to determine the weather?

- **Wulfred, 4th level magic-user**
  - A thin man in his late 30s, balding, dresses like a stereotypical wizard as
    if he wants to make sure everyone knows that's what he is.  Apprenticed to
    Mostlemyre Drouge.
  - **Demeanour:** Irritable, brash, considers himself better than most people.
  - **Speech:** Nasal, abrupt.  Woldish, Old Woldish.
  - **Desires:** Spells, tomes, and magic items.  Fame and respect.
  - **Possessions:** A ruby *ring of protection*, ley-line sensing pendulum.
    Spells: *Detect Magic*, *Read Magic*, *Continual Light*, *Mirror Image*.
