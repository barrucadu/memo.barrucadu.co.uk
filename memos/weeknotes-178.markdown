## Work

Well, it's over.  I'm on leave for the rest of February, and then
start my new job on the 8th of March.  I will have to go back into the
GDS office at some point before then to return my laptop, but that's
it.

I'm now, effectively, unemployed for a month.

We had a leavers call, I received some presents (a few books from [my
wishlist][], a new game, and subscriptions to [a tea-of-the-month
service][] and [a boardgame magazine][]).  I got a card.  It was all
very nice.

## Books

This week I read:

- Volume 1 of [So I'm a Spider, So What?][] by Okina Baba

  I recently watched the anime for this and quite liked it, so I
  decided to check out the light novels.  They're very "light novel":
  more or less just the internal monologue of the viewpoint characters
  put into print, stream-of-consciousness style.  Everyone acts and
  speaks very anime.

  Well, it's enjoyable, and I don't exactly go into light novels
  expecting high literature.

I've also been reading [Designing Data-Intensive Applications][], but
still have a few chapters to go.

## RPG Blog

This week I shared [my Traveller cheatsheets][], which I've been using
to run [my campaign][] for the last few months.

## Miscellaneous

My books escaped containment (see photo) a few months ago, and I
really wanted some more bookcases, but didn't know where I'd fit them.

![The book leak.](weeknotes-178/book-leak.jpg)

In a moment of sheer brilliance, I realised that I *don't* just have
to put all my furniture against the walls, leaving the centre of the
room empty and useless: I can put things there too!  So I'm going to
move my sofa and coffee table into the middle of the room and that
frees up some more wall space for bookcases.

But then I really am out of space.
