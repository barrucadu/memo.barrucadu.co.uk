> Rikiu was watching his son Shoan as he swept and watered the garden path.  "Not clean enough,"
> said Rikiu, when Shoan had finished his task and bade him try again. After a weary hour the son
> turned to Rikiu: "Father, there is nothing more to be done. The steps have been washed for the
> third time, the stone lanterns and the trees are well sprinkled with water, moss and lichens are
> shining with a fresh verdure; not a twig, not a leaf have I left on the ground." "Young fool,"
> chided the tea-master, "that is not the way a garden path should be swept." Saying this, Rikiu
> stepped into the garden, shook a tree and scattered over the garden gold and crimson leaves,
> scraps of the brocade of autumn!
