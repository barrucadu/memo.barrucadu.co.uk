## Work

Starting this week we decided to try out a two-week sprint, as the
team has grown a lot since one-week sprints were introduced, and there
was some concern that the weekly planning meeting was largely just a
waste of effort.  Since we don't *really* make a commitment to getting
all the tickets completed within the sprint, I'm not sure why we don't
just ditch sprints entirely and work directly off a prioritised
backlog (with a periodic meeting for a small number of people to
review it).

I got a few things done this week.  I helped a couple of other members
of the team finally get a ticket over the line which contributes to
migrating away from whitehall-frontend (which had been in "doing" for
a fortnight!), and I [migrated all the functionality][] of the
[calendars][] app into the [frontend][] app, so we can get rid of it.

At GOV.UK we use "micro"services, but we don't do automatic
deployments yet, so we've decided that some of our apps are just *too
micro* for them to be worth it.

I also arranged to take the week after next off, as the blurring
together of days is making me want a break.

## The Plague

Nothing new to report.  I've not caught it yet, the only impact of the
situation is that I'm stuck at home.


## Miscellaneous

### Books

This week I read [Hyperion][], for the first time since 2016.  I then
started on [Gardens of the Moon][], the first book of Malazan.

I also bought a bunch of new books, as I wanted some fantasy to get stuck into:

- [The Final Empire][], by Brandon Sanderson
- [Tales of the Dying Earth][], by Jack Vance
- [Assassin's Apprentice][], by Robin Hobb
- and [The Book of the New Sun][] by Gene Wolfe

I plan to go through the [Fantasy Masterworks][] and [SF Masterworks][] series and decide on some more new books to get.

### Games

This week I ran a Call of Cthulhu one-shot instead of my Golden Sky
Stories game, as coming up with heartwarming stories is difficult.
The players liked it, though they didn't get to solve much of the
mystery before all the evidence got destroyed, and I'm thinking of
running a follow-up scenario.

### Redecorating

I decided to do a bit of redecorating, and merged my office into my
living room.  It's not like I'll be having people over in the near
future, so it's nice to use the huge dining table I bought for
boardgames as a desk instead.  Carrying two bookcases and 300+ books
down a flight of stairs is not very easy, but also not as difficult as
I thought.  I then ordered a couple of new bookcases from IKEA, as my
current ones are almost full.
