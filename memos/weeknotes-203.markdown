## Work

Well, it's back to full-time WFH for me: they're closing the office
until the end of September for refurbishments.

## Books

This week I read:

- [The Once and Future King][] by T. H. White, which I picked up
  mistaking it for a translation of the more famous *Le Morte
  d'Arthur*.

  But despite not being what I expected, T.H. White's retelling of the
  classic tale was still a good book.  This is my first foray into
  Arthurian literature (well, unless you count those bits of *The
  Mabinogion*).  The book is obviously heavily inspired by White's
  experiences of World War II, and a central theme of the book is
  Arthur (at Merlin's behest) trying to find a good outlet for might
  and force, so that the world could progress to a state beyond "might
  makes right".

  There's an amusing scene where Mordred accuses Lancelot and
  Guinevere of having an affair (which is an open secret that Arthur
  is aware of), in an attempt to bring Arthur down by forcing him to
  execute his wife and denounce his friend.  Arthur responds by saying
  that the Queen would, of course, be able to choose a champion to
  fight for her honour.  Mordred protests, saying she will choose
  Lancelot, who is the greatest knight, and will therefore win
  regardless of her guilt.

  Arthur responds:

  > But then, you see, moot points have to be settled somehow, once
  > they get thrust upon us.  If an assertion cannot be proved, then
  > it must be settled some other way, and nearly all of these ways
  > are unfair to somebody.  It is not as if you would have to fight
  > the Queen's champion in your own person, Mordred.  You could plead
  > infirmity and hire the strongest man you knew to fight for you,
  > and the Queen would, of course, get the strongest man she knew to

  > it is usually the richest person who wins, whether he hires the
  > most expensive arguer or the most expensive fighter, so it is no
  > good pretending that this is simply a matter of brute force.

  So even in a world of laws, Might still makes Right: it's just the
  might of riches rather than arms.

## Roleplaying Games

This week I ran [Winter's Daughter][], an adventure for Old School
Essentials (which I previously used for [my Forbidden Lands
one-shot][]), for a group at work.  Two players had played a bit of 5E
before, two hadn't played any RPGs before.  We also only had two and a
half hours to get through character creation and enough of the
adventure to leave a good first impression.

So we'd hit the ground running, before the session I:

- Printed a bunch of character sheets and two copies of the Ability
  Score Modifier tables (page 21 of OSE Advanced Fantasy Player's
  Tome)

- Picked a list of classes they could choose from:
  - Fighty types: Cleric, Dwarf, Fighter
  - Magicy types: Druid, Elf, Magic-User
  - Sneaky types: Halfling, Ranger, Thief

- Rolled two sets of random equipment for each class (using the
  Dolmenwood tables: Dwarf equipment as Fighter; Druid armour as
  Hunter, weapons as Friar; Halfling equipment as Thief; and Ranger
  equipment as Hunter)

I was going to roll up two full characters of each class, but didn't
get around to it.  Then, when the game began, first we rushed through
an abbreviated character creation in which I made sure their
characters were a little tougher than usual:

1. Roll 4d6 drop lowest, in order, for ability scores
2. Pick a class (ignoring requisites and XP bonuses / penalties, in
   fact they didn't look at the class descriptions at all, I just gave
   the names hoping the tropes would be enough context---they were)
3. Note down ability score modifiers
4. Choose a set of equipment
4. Note down AC
5. Roll hit points (re-rolling 1s and 2s)
6. Elfs and Magic-Users roll for spells and choose what they have
   prepared

Then I gave a very brief intro to old-school play, which boiled down
to these three points:

- Describe what you're doing, don't just ask to roll
- Think creatively, this isn't a video game or board game
- Be cautious, 1st level characters are flimsy

And then the adventure started!  I'd prepared an intro spiel
beforehand, wherein I gave a bit of background, described their
immediate surroundings, and finished with a good old "what do you do?"

> You have all been hired by a wizard to go to a centuries-old burial
> mound and retrieve for him a ring that was buried with the occupant.
> A bronze band set with a moonstone, with fittings in the form of
> woven branches.  He said he doesn’t know who was buried there, but
> that his magical researches have led him to become aware of this
> ring.  And as for why he’s interested in the ring, well, he said
> that all you really need to know is that he’s sufficiently
> interested in it to pay you 5,000 gold pieces to fetch it, which is
> quite a good sum of money.
>
> So, you journeyed through the forest all of yesterday, camped for
> the night, and got up well rested this morning for your assault on
> the burial mound.  You can see ahead of you the trees open up, into
> what looks like a clearing, and there’s a very overgrown path
> heading in.  In the clearing you see the mound: a large flat-topped
> hillock, clearly artificial.  And you can hear, coming from along
> the path, towards the mound, the quiet sound of clanking metal.
>
> What do you do?

Over the course of the session, they:

- Spent a while looking at and throwing rocks at the iron owls in the
  trees (they decided it was time to move on when I described two of
  the owls taking off and flying away in the same direction)
- Licked the standing stones outside the mound
- Managed to pry open the big granite slab in front of the door
- Dealt with some magically animated objects (the Magic-User, one of
  the new players, finished them off with Sleep, which was excellent
  timing as they then had to leave early: right after saving the day
  by using their one prepared spell)
- Explored the burial mound
- Annoyed some skeletons
- Tied a rope to the one character who got covered with magical
  levitation slime, and dragged them around the dungeon like a balloon
- Figured out what the riddle meant, and found *half* of the answer
- And finished the session by finding a portal to Fairy

The two players who had some experience with RPGs before were more
proactive at the start of the session, but the two newbies gradually
got into it too, which was great to see happening.  By the end,
everyone had had a good time, and they were asking about next time.

So next time will pick up with the Magic-User returning with two other
companions (I said I'd run for up to 6 people, but only 4 could make
it this week), and then, I assume, them heading into Fairy.  I think
they think the second part of the riddle is there (it's not, they
missed a secret), so I have no idea how that will turn out.

I haven't really thought about what the campaign will turn into after
Winter's Daughter, I'd planned this to just be a single adventure, but
everyone seems keen to continue... it'll have to be something fairly
easy to drop in and out of, because there's more than 6 people in
total who want to play, and also I don't expect consistent attendance
(this being an after-work game), or for everyone who tries it to stick
around.  I'll hold a session 0 after we finish the adventure and see
what everyone's interested in.

## Miscellaneous

I watched [Prey][], the 2022 Predator film this week.

I liked it.  It just repeated the successful formula of the first
Predator film: one Predator against a bunch of people who go from
"there's something out there, maybe a bear?" to full-on invisible
Predator leaping between trees while blowing people up with futuristic
weaponry.

My only complaint would be that the big fight at the end felt a bit
rushed.  They'd spent the film building up the Predator as this super
strong fighter, but then two people are able to deal with it without a
huge amount of difficulty (well ok, one of them dies) when they manage
to figure out that it uses heat vision.
