> In the city of Sāvatthī in northern India, the Buddha had a large
> centre where people would come to meditate and to listen to his Dhamma
> talks. Every evening one young man used to come to hear his
> discourses. For years he came to listen to the Buddha but never put
> any of the teaching into practice.
> 
> After a few years, one evening this man came a little early and found
> the Buddha alone. He approached him and said, "Sir, I have a question
> that keeps arising in my mind, raising doubts."
> 
> "Oh? There should not be any doubts on the path of Dhamma; have them
> clarified. What is your question?"
> 
> "Sir, for many years now I have been coming to your meditation center,
> and I have noticed that there are a large number of recluses around
> you, monks and nuns, and a still larger number of lay people, both men
> and women. For years some of them have been coming to you. Some of
> them, I can see, have certainly reached the final stage; quite
> obviously they are fully liberated. I can also see that others have
> experienced some change in their lives. They are better than they were
> before, although I cannot say that they are fully liberated. But sir,
> I also notice that a large number of people, including myself, are as
> they were, or sometimes they are even worse. They have not changed at
> all, or have not changed for the better.
> 
> "Why should this be, sir? People come to you, such a great man, fully
> enlightened, such a powerful, compassionate person. Why don't you use
> your power and compassion to liberate them all?"
> 
> The Buddha smiled and said, "Young man, where do you live? What is
> your native place?"
> 
> "Sir, I live here in Sāvatthī, this capital city of the state of
> Kosala."
> 
> "Yes, but your facial features show that you are not from this part of
> the country. Where are you from originally?"
> 
> "Sir, I am from the city of Rājagaha, the capital of the state of
> Magadha. I came and settled here in Sāvatthī a few years ago."
> 
> "And have you severed all connections with Rājagaha?"
> 
> "No sir, I still have relatives there. I have friends there. I have
> business there."
> 
> "Then certainly you must go from Savatthī to Rājagaha quite often?"
> 
> "Yes sir. Many times each year I visit Rājagaha and return to
> Sāvatthī."
> 
> "Having travelled and returned so many times on the path from here to
> Rājagaha, certainly you must know the path very well?"
> 
> "Oh yes, sir, I know it perfectly. I might almost say that even if I
> was blindfolded I could find the path to Rājagaha, so many times have
> I walked it."
> 
> "And your friends, those who know you well, certainly they must know
> that you are from Rājagaha and have settled here? They must know that
> you often visit Rājagaha and return, and that you know the path from
> here to Rājagaha perfectly?"
> 
> "Oh yes, sir. All those who are close to me know that I often go to
> Rājagaha and that I know the path perfectly."
> 
> "Then it must happen that some of them come to you and ask you to
> explain to them the path from here to Rājagaha. Do you hide anything
> or do you explain the path to them clearly?"
> 
> "What is there to hide, sir? I explain it to them as clearly as I can:
> you start walking towards the east and then head towards Banaras, and
> continue onward until you reach Gaya and then Rājagaha. I explain it
> very plainly to them sir."
> 
> "And these people to whom you give such clear explanation, do all of
> them reach Rājagaha?"
> 
> "How can that be, sir? Those who walk the entire path to its end, only
> they will reach Rājagaha."
> 
> "This is what I want to explain to you, young man. People keep coming
> to me knowing that this is someone who has walked the path from here
> to nibbāna and so knows it perfectly. They come to me and ask, ‘What
> is the path to nibbāna, to liberation?' And what is there to hide? I
> explain it to them clearly: ‘This is the path.' If somebody just nods
> his head and says, ‘Well said, well said, a very good path, but I
> won't take a step on it; a wonderful path, but I won't take the
> trouble to walk over it,' then how can such a person reach the final
> goal?"
> 
> "I do not carry anyone on my shoulders to take him to the final
> goal. Nobody can carry anyone else on his shoulders to the final
> goal. At most, with love and compassion one can say, ‘Well, this is
> the path, and this is how I have walked on it. You also work, you also
> walk, and you will reach the final goal.' But each person has to walk
> himself, has to take every step on the path himself. He who has taken
> one step on the path is one step nearer the goal. He who has taken a
> hundred steps is a hundred steps nearer the goal. He who has taken all
> the steps on the path has reached the final goal. You have to walk on
> the path yourself."
