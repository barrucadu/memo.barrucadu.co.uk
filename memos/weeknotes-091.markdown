## Work

This week the team gained a frontend dev, which will help a lot with
implementing our MVP.  So I had a kickoff meeting with them talking
through what we're working on and, a couple of days later, a chat with
our interaction designer to work out exactly what designs we need.

A lot of meetings in general this week. They seem to come with the
territory of tech leading.  I think they were all useful, though.

## Books

This week I read a bunch of [Penguin Little Black Classics][]:

[Penguin Little Black Classics]: http://www.littleblackclassics.com/

- **The Constitution of the United States**, which also includes the
  amendments and the declaration of independence.

  I like how the constitution enumerates the things which Congress can
  legislate on... which means almost every amendment ends with:

  > Congress shall have power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation.

  I also found it funny that King George didn't appreciate the "manly
  firmness" of the Americans:

  > He [King George III] has dissolved Representative Houses
  > repeatedly, for opposing with manly firmness his invasions on the
  > rights of the people.

- **Only Dull People Are Brilliant At Breakfast**, by Oscar Wilde.
  He's got some good quotes, a few favourites were:

  > The only thing that sustains one through life is the consciousness
  > of the immense inferiority of everybody else, and this is a
  > feeling that I have always cultivated.

  Which was immediately followed by:

  > I am so clever that sometimes I don't understand a single word of
  > what I am saying.

- **Why I Am so Clever**, by Friedrich Nietzsche.  He really doesn't
  like Germans or German culture.

- **How Much Land Does A Man Need?**, by Leo Tolstoy.  This was a joy
  to read compared to Nietzsche, Tolstoy is definitely better at this
  writing business.

- **The Life of a Stupid Man**, by Ryunosuke Akutagawa.  Not much to
  say about this one.

- **Socrates' Defence**, by Plato.  He's witty, but it's pretty easy
  to see why everyone hated Socrates.  He gets accused of being an
  atheist, and so he asks if there is anyone who "believes in the
  things of men, but not in men", or "in horsey things, but not in
  horses".
