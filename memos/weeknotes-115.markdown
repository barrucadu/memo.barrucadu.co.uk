## Work

This week I did a little bit of accounts work, [implementing a little
A/B testing framework][] which stores the variant a user should see
against their account (so if you change devices you don't change
variant, which is currently the case on GOV.UK), and [reviewing all
the flash & error messages][] to make them match our designs.  I've
also been working with our lead dev to figure out what our
out-of-hours tech support will be like, and with our privacy expert to
work out what sorts of aggregate analyses we can implement without
compromising privacy.

Then I went on support, covering someone else's shift.  It's been
mostly quiet so far, but I seem to have a knack for ending up on
support in the same week something gets launched, and indeed [the
covid restriction postcode checker][] came back on Thursday!

## Books

This week I've been reading [Midnight Tides][], and should finish it
some time next week.  It's been good getting back to Malazan: sci-fi
is nice, but it doesn't scratch the same itch as high fantasy.

## Miscellaneous

I've been thinking about my finances quite a bit this week.

After the March payday next year I'll have met all my current
financial goals: several months expenses and a small generic emergency
fund in cash in my bank account, and a larger emergency fund in
premium bonds.

It's taken quite a few years to get to this point because I've also
been investing into my S&S ISA to build up long-term savings; my
discretionary spending has been quite high; and I had to spend a big
chunk of my savings on furniture last year.  But the end is, finally,
near.

So I need new financial goals.

I don't really have any long-term plans, so I've decided to prioritise
investing.  I've decided to invest £900/month in a combination of my
S&S ISA, premium bonds, and a new LISA (to save up for a house
deposit), and to also overpay on my student loan by £100/month.  My
income is high enough that I *will* pay off the loan in the next few
years, so I'd prefer to get it done sooner rather than later (and
it'll be nice not having a chunk taken out of every payslip).  The
rest of my income will go to maintaining my bank balances, and having
a sizeable discretionary spending budget (£100/month).  I'm not
expecting any significant pay increases next year, but if that does
happen, I'll probably allocate more to investing.
