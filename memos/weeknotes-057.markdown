## Work

- Nothing really worth calling out in particular, just a few different
  small things.  Sometimes you just have an unproductive week.

## Miscellaneous

- I read [The Shadow Rising][] (by Robert Jordan), the fourth book in
  the Wheel of Time series.

- On Monday I told my landlord that I couldn't afford his £325k asking
  price, saying I could only get to about £300k.  On Friday he got
  back to me and asked if that offer still stood, which it does.  So
  next week I'm going back to the bank to get a decision-in-principle
  and to ask if they can recommend a solicitor or conveyancer.

- On Sunday I bought some new books:
  - [Overlord][] (by Kugane Maruyama) volumes 2 and 3;
  - [The Terror][] (by Dan Simmons), which has a great TV adaptation;
  - [Tales of Mystery & the Macabre][], a collection of Elizabeth
    Gaskell's stories; and
  - [The Vorrh][] (by Brian Catling).

- I upgraded my machines to NixOS 19.09.  Other than [a couple of
  tweaks][] to my config this was pretty flawless.
