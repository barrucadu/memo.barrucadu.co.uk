Pitch
-----

You're a group of bright-eyed new magi, fresh from your
apprenticeships.  You've managed to persuade your tutors to allow you
to venture off and establish a new Covenant (wizard community); but
really they think this is a bad idea, and to prove their point they're
only giving you minimal support.

**The Game:** establishing a new self-sufficient wizard base, dealing
with hostile locals (possibly from the nobility, the church, the fae,
Hell; or all four), with little outside help.

### Prep

#### Premise

- Short-term campaign focussed on newly-gauntleted magi establishing a
  new covenant with little support from their parens.  They've given
  you some money, resources, and grogs (redshirts), and kicked you out
  with a "good luck!"
- That is still likely to be several in-game years
- If the game really takes off and we want to keep it going, I'm not
  necessarily averse to doing that---I don't have a fixed 10-session
  story planned, for instance---but if we do that I'd prefer to switch
  to troupe-style play, where I'm not the only GM, and so I get to
  play too.
- Basic setting details: medieval Europe, all the myths are true, The
  Gift, Order of Hermes, Code of Hermes, Hermetic Magic.
- Basic system details: characteristics, abilities, dice,
  spellcasting, spell design, labs, auras, regio, etc.

#### Discussion

- Pure Fantasy vs Meticulous Realism But With Wizards scale --- I'm
  thinking somewhere in the middle (standard medieval fantasy
  pseudo-Europe, with real geography, and a modern interpretation of
  medieval culture).

- Saga Speed --- I'm thinking Medium, where a single game session will
  cover one to four seasons.

- What sort of themes do you want / not want?

- Where in Europe to set it?
  - Rome: Italy and North Africa
  - Rhine: Germany
  - Normandy: Northern France
  - Provence: Southern France
  - Iberia: Spain and Portugal
  - Transylvania: the Danube Basin and North Balkans
  - Thebes: Greece and Constantinople
  - The Levant: the Holy Land
  - Novgorod: Russia and Poland
  - Greater Alps: Switzerland and the Alpine area
  - Hibernia: Ireland
  - Loch Leglean: Scotland
  - Stonehenge: England and Wales

#### To Do

- Covenant creation
  - Just Books and Hooks, Build Points can be spent between sessions
- Magi creation
  - You may or may not all want to be of the same House
  - Spells can be done between sessions
- Companion creation

### Notes

- Set on the East coast of Scotland (Vikings?)
- Custom minor personality flaw: weird sheltered upbringing in a tiny
  Latin-speaking community.

- **Between sessions:**
  - Choose spells
  - Fill covenant library
  - Choose vis sources
  - Make companions

### Next time

- Walk through lab work
- Introductory adventure
