## Work

- I was on support Monday and Tuesday, it was nicely uneventful.

- We ran the Learning to Rank prototype for a day with 50% of
  production traffic, and it worked pretty well - all the metrics were
  moving in the right direction.  We want to run a longer test to get
  more data, but not while almost everyone is out over the Christmas
  period (in case something goes wrong).

- I started looking into how we can use [AWS SageMaker][] for training
  and hosting the model.

## Miscellaneous

- I read [Crossroads of Twilight][] (by Robert Jordan), the tenth book
  in the Wheel of Time series.
