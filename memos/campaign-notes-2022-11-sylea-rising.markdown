<aside class="highlight">I am now using <a href="https://obsidian.md/">Obsidian</a> for campaign notes, this memo won't be updated.</aside>

Overview
--------

We're using **Traveller** to play a **post-post-apocalypse exploration-focussed
campain**.  We're using a custom setting derived from the official Traveller
lore, but aren't worrying about slavishly sticking to that: **published lore is
an inspiration, not a constraint**.

There's **no overarching plot or set game length**, this is an **episodic**
campaign which we'll play for as long as it's fun.  We want **lots of
exploration**, **character stories** as well as **space stories**, and
**small-scale politics**.  **Interstellar politics is in the background**, we're
not directly interacting with that sort of thing.

We play a pretty grounded game: **actions have consequences** and **you can
die**, but it's **not a meatgrinder**.  Also **space-magic is silly**, if it
does come up at all, **psionics is only for a very rare big-boss NPC**.

### Pitch

> The Ziru Sirka, the great interstellar empire of the Vilani, lasted for two
> thousand years.  But inability to manage such a large expanse of territory
> caused a slow decline, which ultimately led to its conquest by the Terrans,
> and the establishment of their great interstellar empire: the Rule of Man.
>
> But the Rule of Man lasted a scant few centuries before it, too, collapsed
> under its own weight.  This time, nothing replaced it.  The galaxy fell into
> anarchy, worlds were cut off from one another, technologies were lost, and
> many civilisations simply failed to survive: this is the Long Night, and this
> is when our game is set.
>
> In the Long Night many small pocket empires rose, and fell.  You are all
> scouts, ex-military, and similar sorts, employed by the government of the
> Sylean Federation, one of the larger pocket empires of the Long Night.  It's
> survived for 650 years now, but Sylea, too, is feeling the strain of
> administration at interstellar distances, and is also currently at war with
> two other pocket empires: the Interstellar Confederacy and the Chanestin
> Kingdom.  Can Sylea solve its problems, or will it perish like so many others?
>
> **Player buy-in:** The player characters are all explorers working government
> contracts to reach out to worlds not heard from in centuries (or millennia),
> to establish peaceful relations where possible, or maybe just to plunder them
> if the world is dead---after all, who's to say you handed in *everything* you
> found to the government inspectors?  It's post-apocalypse in space.  There
> will be space dungeons.  But it's also about the rise of the Sylean Federation
> into something even greater, so there's plenty of scope for this to turn into
> a more political game if you want.

### Game Log

- **Session 0.** Decided what sort of campaign we wanted, created characters:
  all ready for session 1!

- **Act 1: Introductions.**
  - **Session 1: Murder on Arcturus Station (1).** Threw themselves into the
    deep end by shooting Urshukaan themselves.  Interviewed Martin, Sharik,
    Chaijin, Moshe, Eayukheal.  Suspect Eayukheal did it.

  - **Session 2: Murder on Arcturus Station (2).** Broke into Urshukaan's files
    and got all the motives.  Fleshed out the timeline more.  Caught Katarin in
    a lie.

  - **Session 3: Murder on Arcturus Station (3).** Searched Katarin's room and
    found the door ajar.  Good Cop / Bad Copped her into a confession.  Got
    paid, set off to survey Uudge She, J-Drive went boom!

  - **Session 4: Uudge She.** Surveyed the world, and met with the locals and
    learned their mythology.  Tried to convince them that they're not gods.
    Found spare parts, did a very cursory survey while being attacked by demons,
    and escaped.  Vega / Petr go on a date, Sly hires Ed.

  - **Session 5: Mission to Mithril (1).** Set off to Indmen with Prof. Arif,
    but got a job to take some cargo to a science expedition on Kuurashbir along
    the way.  Unfortunately, Mission to Mithril happened.  Half-way to the
    survivors, facing down a giant snow-worm.

  - **Session 6: Mission to Mithril (2).** Rescue the scientists, shoot up the
    mercenaries, make it to Kir.

  - **Session 7: Secrets of the Ancients / Third Imperium** Meet Crayg.  Explore
    the Ancients site on Indmen, and decide a larger team needs to be involved.
    Then get caught up in the founding of the Third Imperium.

- **Act 2: Lost In Space.** Due to a misjump caused by a maintenance technician
  bought off by Crayg, the crew end up in 1601 Iksar, and have to make their way
  home through uncharted space!

  - **Session 8: Misjump / Human Club!** The ship badly misjumps, looking like
    it just blew up to observers on Raluug---but actually arrived in Iksar!
    With money that's no good here, the Travellers get taken in by Admiral
    Fonduk in exchange for "favours".  The first promise: amuse his
    human-obsessed daughter.

  - **Session 9: Okhsaks Ambush / Haunted City!** The Okhsaks Corsairs try to
    abduct Admiral Fonduk's daughter, but get counter-ambushed by the
    Travellers.  After an extended stay in hospital, they go investigate an
    ancient human city rumoured to be haunted.  It's spooky, and has signs of
    life.

  - **Session 10: Session 0.2** Decided how we wanted the campaign to go from
    here, created new characters.

  - **Session 11: Upcoming!** Imperium Gang
  - **Session 12: Upcoming!** Vargr Gang

  haven't reached TL 13 yet (some TL 13 tech may exist as early prototypes, but
  is not generally available)

- Jump-3 has been invented but isn't available outside military / government use
  yet.

  - Sylea renamed to "Capital".
  - Ukan Sector renamed to "Core Sector".

### Polities of Lishun Sector

In addition to these larger polities, there are many independent worlds.  These
are intentionally not fleshed out.  Dead worlds, archaeological finds, hostile
aliens, strange facilities, caches of technology... anything could be out there.

#### Third Imperium

The Sylean Federation was replaced by the Third Imperium at the start of Year 0.

The Third Imperium controls several hundred worlds mostly within about 30
parsecs of Capital (previously called Sylea), in the Core (previously called
Ukan) sector (rimward).  Lishun sector is more or less beyond the frontier:
officially, the Capital / Vland trade corridor in the Shuun and Welling
subsectors is part of the Imperium, but is wild and dangerous with rampant
piracy beyond the range of starport and planetary defenses.

**Governance:** Worlds are largely self-governing, with each part of the domain
of a hereditary noble who is also part of the Moot, an advisory body to the
emperor.

Imperial Law governs interstellar trade and prohibits certain crimes such as
chattel slavery and the manufacture or possession of weapons of mass
destruction, but otherwise leaves local law up to the individual planets.

The current emperor is the 57-year-old Cleon Zhunatsu, a very popular leader who
oversaw rapid expansion of the Sylean Federation and then its transformation
into the Third Imperium.

**Society:** The society is equitable, with Syleans, Solomani, and Vilani all
mixing together in all tiers of society, though ethnic Syleans are
over-represented in the Senate.  Humans make up the vast majority of the
population, though there is a small population of Vargr, and trace numbers of
Aslan.

**Recent history:** The recent history of the Third Imperium is the recent
history of the current ruling dynasty, the Zhunastu family.  Felix Zhunastu, a
previous Grand Duke of Sylea, persuaded the Grand Senate to grant the president
broad and expansive powers.  He also used the Zhunastu family fortune to acquire
several key corporations and merge them into the Zhunastu Industries
megacorporation, which mostly deals with research and development, holds several
military contracts, and has developed the first prototype jump-3 ships.

When Felix died, he left behind his heir the 27-year-old Cleon Zhunastu, who
assumed the roles of Grand Duke of Sylea, president of the Grand Senate, and
chairman of Zhunastu Industries.

Cleon founded the Sylean Federation Scout Service, which triggered a period of
rapid expansion, a mixture of recruitment and conquest.  Many currently
independent worlds are considering membership, having either applied themselves
or having been invited due to their economic, technological, or strategic
merits.

After holding the presidency for 30 years, Cleon succeeded in his greatest aim:
the transformation of the Sylean Federation into the Third Imperium, a
self-styled successor state to the Ziru Sirka and the Rule of Man, claiming
authority over the thousands of worlds once members of those previous states.

This change also replaced the elected Grand Senate with a hereditary nobility
who are delegated significant powers to manage their domains, which is Cleon's
solution to the difficulty of administration at interstellar distances.

##### Uundas Union

The Uundas Union is a fragmented polity, disparate worlds which survived the
Long Night somewhat intact using a fleet of left-over Ziru Sirka cargo ships
maintained by the decaying high tech facilities on Uundas.  But now those
facilities have degraded to the point that the Union has to buy old Imperial
ships and use the repair facilities of Raluug starport to keep its internal
trade afloat.

**Relationship with the Third Imperium:** Somewhere between a small trading
partner and a captive government.  The significantly more powerful economy and
technological base of the Third Imperium is slowly forcing the Union towards
assimilation, something the more independence-minded worlds of the Union are not
happy with.

##### Paran League

The government of Paran is a distant remnant of the Ziru Sirka bureaus, with the
world, and the league, ruled by an ancient hereditary caste of bureaucrats who
operate by the maxim "from each according to his ability, to each according to
his needs."  Each member world of the League sends excess production to Paran,
where the bureaucrats distribute it to worlds where it's needed.  Member
governments are subordinate to the bureaucrats of Paran, but are mostly left to
rule without interference, on the assumption that those who live on a world
understand what it and its people need better than those who live elsewhere.

**Relationship with the Third Imperium:** The bureaucrats of Paran are
unfriendly to those they view as official envoys of the Third Imperium: to them,
the Imperium has more than it could possibly need, and so has a duty to
distribute that excess to others at no cost.  However, they don't go so far as
turning away Imperial traders.

##### Gishgi People's Assembly

Long ago, the people of Gishgi threw off the authoritarian yoke of their
masters, killing and literally eating the rich in a grand revolution.  They took
their crusade to the stars and liberated another six worlds, installing on each
world a governing Assembly of the People, with each Planetary Assembly sending a
number of representatives (proportional to the population) to the Supreme
Assembly of the People, based on Gishgi.  Now, centuries later, another five
worlds have been added to the Assembly, and the Secretary-General of the Supreme
Assembly of the People rules with the aid of the State Secret Police as an
unpopular totalitarian ruler.

**Relationship with the Third Imperium:** The Third Imperium has been officially
branded a Threat to the Mental Wellbeing and Contentment of the People, and
Imperial ships barred from the People's Assembly's territory.

##### Gzoerrghzae Fleet

The Gzoerrghzae Fleet is a loose coalition of worlds that each maintain a small
self-defense force and agrees to mutual defense and anti-corsair activity.
Beyond that, each world is totally independent.  And, Vargr society being what
it is, it's not exactly the case that the *world government* maintains a small
navy, it's more that there's just an established small navy which happens to be
based on the world and has agreed to join the Fleet.

**Relationship with the Third Imperium:** None.

#### History

> 300,000 years ago, a mysterious race now called "the Ancients" took primitive
> humans from their home planet, and seeded them throughout the galaxy.  This
> has made a lot of people very angry and has been widely regarded as a bad
> move.
>
> About 7,000 years ago, the Vilani people from the planet Vland were the first
> humans to discover jump technology.  They gained the ability to travel between

> Ziru Sirka, which in their language means Grand Empire of the Stars.  At its
> height, it controlled over 15,000 worlds spread across 27 sectors of space.
>
> In about 60 years, the Terrans from the planet Earth will discover jump

>
> In about 75 years, first contact will be made between the Terrans and the

>
> And in about 100 years, war will break out between the Terran Confederation
> and the Ziru Sirka.  The Ziru Sirka is far, far bigger, but it's also in the
> midst of a long and slow decline.  Vilani society is very centralised, their
> culture is incredibly rigid, they've stagnated technologically, and with only
> jump-2 ships they simply can't effectively manage their vast territory.
>
> The war lasts about 200 years, and ends with the surrender of the Ziru Sirka.
> One imperium comes to an end, and another begins.  The Terrans---now calling

> That began the Long Night, a period of galactic anarchy which saw the collapse

#### Discussion

##### Campaign

- No overarching story
- The world doesn't resolve around the PCs
- Time skips between sessions if you have no plans
- How long should the campaign last?
- Tone:
  - What kind of conflicts and adventures make sense for this game?
  - What kind of outcomes make sense for this game?
  - What kind of PCs make sense for this game?
  - Ethics (sexism, racism, slavery, etc): use it to make the bad guys obviously
    bad? Anything off limits?
  - Can PCs die?  How frequently?
    - What happens if there's a TPK?

##### Characters

- Alien PCs, yay or nay?
  - Aslan: probably pretty weird if from an Aslan enclave, so far from the
    Hierate.
  - Vargr: the Vargr Extents are just off to coreward, so ethnic Vargr are
    everywhere here.
- Psion PCs, yay or nay?
  - What about psion NPCs?
- Traveller Companion pre-career options, yay or nay?
  - Colonial Upbringing
  - Merchant Academy
  - Psionic Community
  - School of Hard Knocks
  - Spacer Community
- Advancement:
  - How did everyone feel about the standard rules?  I felt it penalised
    characters with low EDU too much.
  - Seth Skorkowsky house rule: mark skills which get used successfully, at the
    end of the adventure roll `1d6-1` for each marked skill and gain 1
    experience point if above the skill level.  Gaining a skill at level 0, or
    taking it from level 0 to level 1, costs 1xp; costs double each level
    thereafter.

  - Knows that **Urshukaan** and **Katarin** were fighting, suspects her motive.

> and you were given a job to find a stolen ore carrier and identify the

>
> Marja doesn't have the resources to investigate a murder herself.  But she
> trusts Sly.  So she's asked you three to look into the matter, to secure

2023-01-08 --- Session 4
------------------------

### Intro

> You're a group of private citizens working government contracts for the Sylean
> Federation Scout Service, out in Lishun Sector.
>
> Right now you're in the Uudge She system, looking into an abandoned Ziru Sirka
> mining outpost, to see if it can be reactivated and used as a source of
> valuable resources.  With you is a team of three prospectors: the chief Arkar
> Ullah, and his two assistants Kaarga Riaz and Petr Idema.
>
> The three-month journey from Raluug was mostly uneventful, other than Petr
> developing a crush on Vega, until the last jump: something struck your ship
> just as you were entering jump, knocking you off course.  Your jump drive
> managed to compensate, but burned itself out in the process, and will take one
> ton of spare parts to be repaired.
>
> You're now in orbit around the world of Uudge She.  You can immediately see
> that it's smaller than Earth, around the size of Mars, it has about 65%
> surface water, and is heavily forested.  Your navigational database says it
> has a tainted atmosphere requiring a filter mask, but no information on what
> that taint is.  And you know that somewhere down there is an old mining
> outpost, hopefully with enough spare parts to get your jump drive up and
> running.

### State

- In 1430 Uudge She
  - World unsurveyed, only physical UWP available
- J-Drive offline until repair
- 9 months until maintenance due
- Pending life support costs: 6 people x 12 weeks

### Prep

#### Prospectors

- **Arkar Ullah:**
  - Male, 56
  - The chief
  - Wears a flat cap and has a thick moustache
  - Doesn't talk much
  - Can identify unrefined metals at a glance

- **Kaarga Riaz:**
  - Male, 43
  - Short and stocky, stronger than he looks
  - Holds his drink well

- **Petr Idema:**
  - Male, 25
  - Narrow face, short copper hair
  - Fairly new to the job, not very experienced
  - Crush on Vega

- Personal equipment: TL10 Vacc Suit, Autopistol, assorted gear (cutting toches, shovels, mineral analysis kit, etc)

#### Uudge She

- Atmospheric taint is metal fragments stirred up by the frequent storms
- Native life is scaly and can seal off orifices (ear / nose plugs, translucent
  eyelids, etc) to protect
- Cool, dry
- Secret Vargr corsair station in orbit around the system's gas giant:
  - 3 Aetin Scouts (with double pulse lasers)
  - 1 Ruguelka Corsair

- **Human inhabitants:**
  - The descendants of the original miners
  - TL0 / stone-age primitives, living in tents with their animals
  - Wear thick hooded cloaks to deal with the metal storms, but prefer being in
    their tents if possible
  - Speak a heavily accented Vilani dialect (`INT / Language (Vilani)`)
  - Have developed a mythology of lost golden age, which the Thunder Gods ended
    by pulling the stars apart and preventing travel between worlds
  - Assume the players are emissaries of the Thunder Gods, sent to judge them
  - More women and children than adult men
  - Adult men have lanthanum-tipped spears (can be identified on sight by Arkar) and are often scarred
  - Consider the mining outpost full of demons
  - Consider passing through the mining outpost, descending into the caves, and obtaining your own spear-tip a rite of passage

- **Mining outpost:**
  - As Hadley's Hope (ALIEN rulebook), but:
    - C block is recreation & family services
    - D block is the mining area (a big pit in the ground with a lift and heavy machinery)
      - Top of pit covered by resin
      - Stairway heading down to caves at the base
    - Ramp from D block to maintenance bay
  - Walls covered by layers upon layers of secreted resin, giving corridors a
    gullet-like appearance
  - Warm, humid, smells of ozone
  - Spare parts in maintenance bay
  - Starting sliens:
    - Creepers (Flatlined): Command Crew Quarters, C1 vents, Medlab, Billy's Bar
    - Chamax (Drinax): North Lock, South Lock, Mass Housing
  - Random Encounters (2-in-6, every 2 turns, then every turn after making noise):
    - 1 radio interference
    - 2, 3 Creeper
    - 4 Chamax

#### Income

- 3 months to establish the colony
- Then it'll produce 500 tons of Uncommon Raw Materials per month (Cr10,000,000/month)
- Of that, assuming 75% is profit (Cr7,500,000/month)
- The PCs get 5%, as the other 5% goes to the prospectors (Cr375,000/month)
- Half the first three paying months to cover the cost of establishing the colony (Cr187,500/month)
- So the PCs will receive:
  - Month 1, 2, 3: Cr187,500
  - Month 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12: Cr375,000
  - Total: Cr3,937,500

- **Back-of-the-napkin profit estimate:**
  - Mortgage is deferred while the PCs are working, so assume they're not paying that
  - Maintenance is Cr22,702/month
  - 82 tons of refined fuel twice a month is Cr41,000/month
  - 30 days of life support for 3 people is Cr6000/month
  - Berthing fees is probably around Cr6000/month
  - Total: Cr75,702/month
  - So they'll have Cr100,000--Cr300,000/month extra, which is a lot, but not a
    fortune - not even enough to pay the mortgage

### Prep

- **Prof. Joe Arif:**
  - Will *not shut up* about the Ancients
  - Considers the Archon Hypothesis absolute poppycock
  - Lalita Ward (grad student) is much more grounded and polite

- **Indmen:**
  - Acid oceans & acid storms
  - Locating the signal origin from orbit: `Difficult INT / Electronics (sensors)`
  - Flying through the storm: `Difficult DEX / Pilot (spacecraft)`
  - Pyramid fires a laser at approaching ships, as in *Shadows*
  - Pyramid interior is Droyne base from *Twilight's Peak*, but:
    - Use Random Encounters from *Secrets of the Ancients*
    - N has two hostile Servitors (*Secrets of the Ancients*)
    - Walls and ceiling are covered in a very detailed and intricate non-repeating geometric design which hurts the eyes and distracts the mind (DM-2 to INT and EDU tasks)
    - No signs of prior human entry
    - Low berths in O cannot be opened
    - S / Z is the stargate room
      - Holographic controls
      - Walls show a starchart as seen from this world 300,000 years ago (`Very Difficult INT / Astrogation`)
      - Pick out six symbols: `Difficult PSI` (characters with psionic potential 5+ only)
      - Recognising the pattern gives the seventh symbol
  - Trying to activate the stargate exhausts the power
    - Prof. suggests plugging the ship into the base!
    - Grad student more sensibly suggests returning with a portable fusion generator
  - Actually activating the stargate gives a burst of gamma radiation (150 rads) and opens a bidirectional portal to another stargate in a lab in the Zhodani Consulate

2023-01-22 --- Session 6
------------------------

### Intro

> Welcome back to Sylea Rising.
>
> Right now you're in the Kuurashbir system, where you stopped over on your way
> to a thrilling xenoarchaeological dig on the world of Indmen, and you got
> caught up in *something*.  An EMP device blew out your ship's gravity control
> circuits, the one piece you happened not to have a replacement for.  The
> downport itself is abandoned, with signs of violence: bullet holes in the
> walls, poorly cleaned up bloodstains, and charred bodies.  Security camera
> footage showed armed mercenaries entering, killing the staff, searching for
> something, and abducting a passenger.
>
> You picked up a signal.  A distress signal coming from the port's air/raft,
> which should have the part you need to fix up your ship and get the hell out
> of here.  Only problem is it's some 1,500km away in the icy wastes.  And who
> knows what's happened and who's out there.
>
> Six days into your journey, in the midst of a light snow, after encountering
> cute lizards, weird bugs, navigating around boulders and rivers, the ground
> trembles, cracks, lurches, and opens up in front of your badass ATV---that has
> a gun---as a giant snow-worm bursts forth and towers above you, its gaping maw
> revealing rings of dozens of teeth surrounding its deep red gullet.
>
> Let's roll initiative.  Who's driving?

### Intro

> Welcome back to Sylea Rising.
>
> Right now you're in the Kir system---which joined the Federation relatively
> recently---on your way to the world of Indmen for an archaeological dig with
> Prof. Arif of the University of Sylea.  Last time you were here, Tama picked a
> fight with a mining company president, and you got caught up in a murder
> investigation.  This time, I'm sure everything will go much more smoothly.
>
> On your ship, in addition to the usual crew, you have two port workers and a
> family of four scientists, who you picked up Kuurashbir after mercenaries
> attacked their world.  They asked you to drop them off in Sylean space, and
> then they could make their own way.  And also, Tama needs to replace his
> missing ID, a tedious process involving taking little photographs and filling
> out forms.
>
> So, under the watchful sensors of Sylean battleships the *Archon's Fist* and
> the *Merciless*, you dock at Kir highport.

  - Harass the PCs a bit:
    - Loudly refer to "Private Tama Nourvakaiken, dishonourably discharged for
      gross incompetence, and cowardice in the face of the enemy"
    - Have the ship searched to make sure they're not smuggling anything
    - Insinuate that the scientists were mis-sold passage, since the ship is far
      too small for so many people
    - Say he'll be in Raluug in a few months, "maybe we could catch up over a
      beer, for old time's sake"
    - etc

- **Indmen:**
  - See session 5 prep
  - They can't power the stargate with the ship's reactor, they have to come
    back for a portable power source: make the climax of act 2 be the Zhodani
    invasion.

2023-02-05 --- Break 1
----------------------

We played the Delta Green scenario *Last Things Last*.

### Intro

> Welcome to Delta Green, I will be your Handler as we play the quick-start
> scenario *Last Things Last*, which is very short and will only take this one
> session.
>
> Previously, we've played Call of Cthulhu, where you play normal people caught
> up in some horrible event, some sanity-blasting mystery or conspiracy, which
> you have to do your best to deal with.  We've also played Pulp Cthulhu, where
> you're more like pulp action heroes, confronting the Unnatural by diving
> through the air firing a gun in each hand.  Delta Green is also about the
> Unnatural, but it's not like those games.
>
> Delta Green is a secret federal agency.  So secret that nobody outside of
> Delta Green itself and the very top of the federal government is even aware of
> its existence.  Delta Green agents and informants are embedded in other
> organisations: FBI, CIA, DEA, other federal and non-federal organisations,
> local law enforcement, many even outside of government entirely.  The job of
> Delta Green is constant vigilance for the Unnatural.  And when the Unnatural
> rears its head, agents, like you, are dispatched to end it.
>
> Not to understand it, because understanding leads to madness and further
> contamination.
>
> Not to solve it, because the Unnatural can't be solved, we can only delay it
> for a while.
>
> You're sent to end it.
>
> To root out the involvement of the Unnatural and make it uninvolved, with
> extreme prejudice.
>
> For its own protection, Delta Green is composed of small semi-independent
> cells.  You are all agents in one such cell.  You have a handler, who relays
> orders from Delta Green leadership, but you have no idea who those leaders
> are, and asking about it is frowned upon.  You don't personally know any
> agents from other cells, you just know that they exist out there, somewhere,
> probably.
>
> Furthermore, you are all new to this cell.  You've not worked together before.
> And now, you're being activated.
>
> So, by way of introduction, let's just go through you all one by one, and have
> a brief scene of you receiving your orders.

### Prep

- **Locations:**
  - Meeting: tiny deli in Grants Pass, Oregon
    - Probably have to fly to Portland or San Francisco or Sacramento and then
      drive several hours to get there
  - Apartment: small run-down building on the outskirts of town
  - Cabin: into the woods near Crescent Lake (4hr drive)

- **Meeting the handler:**
  - Message sent out Thursday afternoon, Handler meeting Friday afternoon
    - Handler is called Agent Collins
  - Cornwell is assigned to a joint terrorism task force
  - McMurty & Schell just get a coded message and have to make their excuses
    - How do they get off work?
  - How do they get to the meeting?  Who's flying in?  Does Cornwell get an FBI car?
  - Meeting is at a deli, have to make a pre-agreed sandwich order as a password
  - In addition to handout, given a burner phone and a number to call

- **In the apartment:**
  - In addition to the papers, a few unmarked VHS tapes (recordings of war
    documentaries), 6 hours worth

- **At the cabin:**
  - Urn for human ashes (empty) engraved "Marlene"
  - Gun safe:
    - 1x bolt action hunting rifle (-20% if used on the round after being
      fired): 100m; 1d12; 10%; AP 3
    - 2x shotgun: 75m; 2d8 (half if firing beyond base range)
  - Two nearby hillbilly hunters: Buck, Hutch
    - HP 12, SAN 60
    - Alertness 30, Firearms 50, Navigate 30, Survival 30, Unarmed Combat 40
    - Bolt action hunting rifle
  - In the footlocker:
    - Records of his Delta Green operations
    - A large iron knife with (human) bone handle, minutely engraved with an
      Arabic prayer to the "Prolonger of Life"
    - An old book bound in (human) leather, in Arabic, detailing the afterlife
      and resurrection: has a ritual to banish The Other (stab it with the knife
      and chant)
  - That Which Was Marlene:
    - If killed, black smoke leaves the corpse and inhabits another one nearby

### Notes

- Got chewed out by the handler for not reporting their movements
- Marlene's spirit escaped, unknown to the characters, but known to the players


2023-02-12 --- Session 8
------------------------

### Intro

> Welcome back to Sylea Rising.
>
> Everyone make a `DEX` check, as you are flung about the bridge by a violent
> explosion that rocks your ship as soon as you enter jump. [`1d3` damage
> ignoring armour to all who fail]
>
> Alarms are blaring, sensors report a huge power surge, you smell burning
> plastic...
>
> But let's rewind a bit.
>
> It's been two months since President Cleon, now Emperor Cleon, declared that
> the Sylean Federation would transform into the Third Imperium, a successor
> state to the Ziru Sirka and the Rule of Man, claiming dominion over all their
> thousands of worlds.
>
> But not much has changed for you on the day-to-day. Your employer is now
> called the "Imperial Interstellar Scout Service", and your ship's transponder
> now says that it's registered in the Third Imperium, and that's about it.
> You're not politicians or high-ranking military officials, just regular old
> joes who boldly go where none have gone before, more or less.
>
> In that time you've been doing small local odd jobs: ferrying cargo and
> passengers between nearby worlds, carrying maintenance teams out to
> satellites, taking samples from gas giants, that sort of thing, but today you
> set out on your next thrilling mission!
>
> Firstly, the scientific expedition to Indmen ordered in a small portable
> fusion reactor, which they hope to use to power the base in case the Ancients
> reactor goes down.  Secondly, the Intelligence Office got back to you, with a
> very detailed background check on you all, and they would like you to sell
> high-tech goods at cut-throat prices in the Uundas Union, as part of a scheme
> to undermine their economy and make them more dependent on the Imperium
>
> So with a portable fusion reactor and 60 tons of advanced manufactured goods
> sitting in your cargo bay, you undocked from the starport, plotted a jump to
> Sikiinili, reached a safe distance, hit the big green button, and
> then... boom.
>
> Come to think of it, you saw Crayg's goons just before you set off.  One of
> them was smirking.

### Prep

  - Severity 3 J-Drive critical hit
  - Severity 3 Hull critical hit

- **Vargr:**
  - All act like teenagers, anime space pirates, or yakuza
  - All call their pack leader "boss"

- **Arrival:**
  - `EDU / Astrogation` to figure out their location
    - 1601 Diir
    - 41 parsecs spatial displacement
  - `INT / Electronics (Comms)` to pick up Vargr comms chatter
  - `INT / Electronics (Sensors)` to spot Vargr ships
  - Upon realising it's a Vargr system, Ed advises Vega to be as flamboyant as possible

- **First contact:**
  - Captain Vaez with a Aerounkhu Packet (AOCS1 p238)
  - Captain Llorrgdaen with a Ruguelka Corsair (AOCS1 p236) and an Avouz Courier (AOCS1 p230)

  - **On ground:**

    - Downport in the midst of buildings
    - Skyscrapers
    - Neon signs and artificial lighting everywhere
    - Wide open streets and squares
    - Everything brightly decorated, but no consistency between adjacent buildings
    - Chaotic layout, as if several grid systems collided
    - Most people travelling in groups
    - Lots of identical businesses right next to each other (eg, food stalls or junk dealers), fiercely competing
    - Public speakers attracting crowds in every square
  - Nobody's heard of the Third Imperium, a few corsairs might have heard of the Sylean Federation
  - Their money is worthless here

    - Entertain his daughter (Alno) for a few days

### Intro

### State

    - week 98: ore shipment #12 sold (Cr375,000 income); end of income

### Prep

- **Threads:**
  - Llorgdaen / Vaez rivalry
  - Llordgaen's ambitions

#### Corsair Threat

##### Hook

- Mysterious cloaked figure in the bar asks Tama to bring Alno to the haunted
  city Cr2000 (paid on delivery)

##### Kidnapping Attempt!

- The haunted city is being consumed by a marsh, there are only a handful of
  suitable landing sites within walking distance.

- Three armed and armoured vargr appear and demand Alno be handed over; one
  remains hidden in a bush with a heavy laser rifle (bush explodes when rifle is
  first used).

- Have an Air/Raft (sealed, so it can reach orbit without needing vacc suits)
  concealed behind the rifle guy.

- 20 hits, +1 to hit

- **Equipment:**
  - Warrior Set (Zurrku-Ekdho) [+9]; Gauss Pistol x2 [3D; AP 3; Auto 2]
  - Warrior Set (Zurrku-Oengga) [+7; +6 arm shield]; Chaindrive Sword [4D; AP 2]
  - Warrior-Leader Set (Vhezk-Zurrku) [+8]; Sonic Rifle [2D; Burst 3; Sonic -3; Stun]; Claw Fist [4D; AP 5]
  - Fighter Set (Kforzgong) [+3]; Heavy Laser Rifle [6D; Scope; on a fixed stand, not held]

#### Hidden Psions

##### Hook

- Iksar Historical Society tells Vega it's reportedly haunted

##### Haunted City

- A large sprawl of decaying overgrown factories and warehouses, being consumed
  by a swamp.
- Home to a secret outpost of blind psionic Vargr (Roth Thokken)

- **Psionic defenses:**
  1. Fog rolls in, obscuring the sky and diffusing the sunlight (too dangerous
     to fly in).
  2. The sound of running feet and children's laughter; barely-seen movement;
     and a sense of dread.  NPCs start to suggest leaving.
  3. Confusion: without something to keep them moving in a straight line, the
     group re-emerge out of the city back where they started.
  4. The ground tears itself open before the party, revealing a bottomless chasm
     20m across with a small narrow ledge 10m down: the chasm is illusory, the
     ledge is the actual floor level, as the party have wandered into a ruined
     building where the floor has fallen into the basement.  If someone falls
     in, they land on the ledge and take 3D damage.  If someone falls into the
     chasm proper, all see them (and they feel) fall off out of sight.
  5. A ghostly vargr of shadow and flame, with long knife-like claws, steps out
     to confront the PCs (2 melee, 4D damage, AP).  Defeated by the belief that
     it isn't real, not by weapons.

- **Damage in the city:**
  - All damage is illusory (other than anything self-inflicted like by running
    into a wall or falling into a basement) and heals upon leaving.
  - Dead characters wake up outside the city.

#### Vargr Merchants

##### Hook

- Guild representatives are at the ship to learn if the humans intend to stick
  around and, if so, to try to get an exclusive trade deal:
  - **Vaeourza** of the **Iksar Merchants Guild**
  - **Rue** of the **Merchants Guild of Iksar**
  - **Ozknerr** of the **Guild of Iksar Merchants**

- Getting a trade deal means:
  - +10% to sale price, -10% to purchase price.
  - Occasional delays to selling cargo, since the right buyers need to be
    brought in.
  - Occasional special requests.

#### Fonduk

##### Meeting Uraz

- Admiral Fonduk will repair their ship for free if they do a favour for his
  buddy Uraz, an emissary of the Defenders of Peace.

- Uraz wants the PCs to bread into the HQ of Ongozzaen Arms and get a copy of
  their shipping data, as they're suspected of having ties to corsair bands.

  *This is "Patron Uraz: Gnoezdanu, Emissary" from JTAS 7.*
