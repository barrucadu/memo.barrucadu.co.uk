<aside class="highlight">This campaign is ongoing and this memo contains spoilers.</aside>


Overview
--------

We're using **Traveller** to play a **post-post-apocalypse exploration-focussed
campain**.  We're using a custom setting derived from the official Traveller
lore, but aren't worrying about slavishly sticking to that: **published lore is
an inspiration, not a constraint**.

There's **no overarching plot or set game length**, this is an **episodic**
campaign which we'll play for as long as it's fun.  We want **lots of
exploration**, **character stories** as well as **space stories**, and
**small-scale politics**.  **Interstellar politics is in the background**, we're
not directly interacting with that sort of thing.

We play a pretty grounded game: **actions have consequences** and **you can
die**, but it's **not a meatgrinder**.  Also **space-magic is silly**, if it
does come up at all, **psionics is only for a very rare big-boss NPC**.

### Pitch

> The Ziru Sirka, the great interstellar empire of the Vilani, lasted for two
> thousand years.  But inability to manage such a large expanse of territory
> caused a slow decline, which ultimately led to its conquest by the Terrans,
> and the establishment of their great interstellar empire: the Rule of Man.
>
> But the Rule of Man lasted a scant few centuries before it, too, collapsed
> under its own weight.  This time, nothing replaced it.  The galaxy fell into
> anarchy, worlds were cut off from one another, technologies were lost, and
> many civilisations simply failed to survive: this is the Long Night, and this
> is when our game is set.
>
> In the Long Night many small pocket empires rose, and fell.  You are all
> scouts, ex-military, and similar sorts, employed by the government of the
> Sylean Federation, one of the larger pocket empires of the Long Night.  It's
> survived for 650 years now, but Sylea, too, is feeling the strain of
> administration at interstellar distances, and is also currently at war with
> two other pocket empires: the Interstellar Confederacy and the Chanestin
> Kingdom.  Can Sylea solve its problems, or will it perish like so many others?
>
> **Player buy-in:** The player characters are all explorers working government
> contracts to reach out to worlds not heard from in centuries (or millennia),
> to establish peaceful relations where possible, or maybe just to plunder them
> if the world is dead---after all, who's to say you handed in *everything* you
> found to the government inspectors?  It's post-apocalypse in space.  There
> will be space dungeons.  But it's also about the rise of the Sylean Federation
> into something even greater, so there's plenty of scope for this to turn into
> a more political game if you want.

### Game Log

- **Session 0.** Decided what sort of campaign we wanted, created characters:
  all ready for session 1!

- **Session 1: Murder on Arcturus Station (1).** Threw themselves into the deep end
  by shooting Urshukaan themselves.  Interviewed Martin, Sharik, Chaijin, Moshe,
  Eayukheal.  Suspect Eayukheal did it.

- **Session 2: Murder on Arcturus Station (2).** Broke into Urshukaan's files
  and got all the motives.  Fleshed out the timeline more.  Caught Katarin in a
  lie.

- **Session 3: Murder on Arcturus Station (3).** Searched Katarin's room and
  found the door ajar.  Good Cop / Bad Copped her into a confession.  Got paid,
  set off to survey Uudge She, J-Drive went boom!

- **Session 4: Uudge She.** Surveyed the world, and met with the locals and
  learned their mythology.  Tried to convince them that they're not gods.  Found
  spare parts, did a very cursory survey while being attacked by demons, and
  escaped.  Vega / Petr go on a date, Sly hires Ed.

- **Session 5: Mission to Mithril (1).** Set off to Indmen with Prof. Arif, but
  got a job to take some cargo to a science expedition on Kuurashbir along the
  way.  Unfortunately, Mission to Mithril happened.  Half-way to the survivors,
  facing down a giant snow-worm.

### Non-Default Assumptions

- TL 12 is the best technology available, the Sylean Federation and its
  neighbours haven't reached TL 13 yet (some TL 13 tech may exist as early
  prototypes, but is not generally available)

- Jump-3 has been invented but isn't available outside military / government use
  yet.

### Polities of Lishun Sector

In addition to these larger polities, there are many independent worlds.  These
are intentionally not fleshed out.  Dead worlds, archaeological finds, hostile
aliens, strange facilities, caches of technology... anything could be out there.

#### Sylean Federation

The Sylean Federation controls several hundred worlds mostly within about 30
parsecs of Sylea, in Ukan sector (rimward).  Lishun sector is more or less
beyond the frontier: officially, the Sylea / Vland trade corridor in the Shuun
and Welling subsectors is part of the Federation, but is wild and dangerous with
rampant piracy beyond the range of starport and planetary defenses.

**Governance:** Worlds are largely self-governing, with each appointing a
senator to the Grand Senate on Sylea, which has the hereditary Grand Duke of
Sylea as its president.

The Grand Senate determines laws for both Sylea and the whole Federation, there
isn't a separate Sylean government.  While Sylea is the only world directly
ruled by the Grand Senate, the oldest worlds of the Federation are civil service
bureaucracies ruled by their senators.  Other worlds, especially out here far
from Sylea, are far more varied.

The current Grand Duke is the 56-year-old Cleon Zhunatsu, a very popular leader
who has overseen rapid expansion of the Federation.

**Society:** The society is equitable, with Syleans, Solomani, and Vilani all
mixing together in all tiers of society, though ethnic Syleans are
over-represented in the Senate.  Humans make up the vast majority of the
population, though there are also trace numbers of Aslan and Droyne, and a small
subpopulation of Vargr.

**Recent history:** The recent history of the Sylean Federation is the recent
history of the current ruling dynasty, the Zhunastu family.  Felix Zhunastu, the
previous Grand Duke, persuaded the Grand Senate to grant the president broad and
expansive powers.  He also used the Zhunastu family fortune to acquire several
key corporations and merge them into the Zhunastu Industries megacorporation,
which mostly deals with research and development, holds several military
contracts, and has developed the first prototype jump-3 ships.

When Felix died, he left behind his heir the 27-year-old Cleon Zhunastu, who
assumed the roles of Grand Duke of Sylea, president of the Grand Senate, and
chairman of Zhunastu Industries.

Cleon founded the Sylean Federation Scout Service, which triggered a period of
rapid expansion, a mixture of recruitment and conquest.  Many currently
independent worlds are considering membership, having either applied themselves
or having been invited due to their economic, technological, or strategic
merits.

Cleon has been president for 30 years now, and shows no sign of slowing down.
It's widely known that he plans to bring even more worlds under Sylean control,
expanding further into Lishun sector once Ukan sector is more firmly under
control.  The people are generally optimistic for the future, and look forward
to seeing what change he brings next.

##### Uundas Union

The Uundas Union is a fragmented polity, disparate worlds which survived the
Long Night somewhat intact using a fleet of left-over Ziru Sirka cargo ships
maintained by the decaying high tech facilities on Uundas.  But now those
facilities have degraded to the point that the Union has to buy old Sylean ships
and use the repair facilities of Raluug starport to keep its internal trade
afloat.

**Relationship with the Sylean Federation:** Somewhere between a small trading
partner and a captive government.  The significantly more powerful economy and
technological base of the Sylean Federation is slowly forcing the Union towards
assimilation, something the more independence-minded worlds of the Union are not
happy with.

##### Paran League

The government of Paran is a distant remnant of the Ziru Sirka bureaus, with the
world, and the league, ruled by an ancient hereditary caste of bureaucrats who
operate by the maxim "from each according to his ability, to each according to
his needs."  Each member world of the League sends excess production to Paran,
where the bureaucrats distribute it to worlds where it's needed.  Member
governments are subordinate to the bureaucrats of Paran, but are mostly left to
rule without interference, on the assumption that those who live on a world
understand what it and its people need better than those who live elsewhere.

**Relationship with the Sylean Federation:** The bureaucrats of Paran are
unfriendly to those they view as official envoys of the Sylean Federation: to
them, the Federation has more than it could possibly need, and so has a duty to
distribute that excess to others at no cost.  However, they don't go so far as
turning away Sylean traders.

##### Gishgi People's Assembly

Long ago, the people of Gishgi threw off the authoritarian yoke of their
masters, killing and literally eating the rich in a grand revolution.  They took
their crusade to the stars and liberated another six worlds, installing on each
world a governing Assembly of the People, with each Planetary Assembly sending a
number of representatives (proportional to the population) to the Supreme
Assembly of the People, based on Gishgi.  Now, centuries later, another five
worlds have been added to the Assembly, and the Secretary-General of the Supreme
Assembly of the People rules with the aid of the State Secret Police as an
unpopular totalitarian ruler.

**Relationship with the Sylean Federation:** The Sylean Federation has been
officially branded a Threat to the Mental Wellbeing and Contentment of the
People, and Sylean ships barred from the People's Assembly's territory.

### Prep

1. Go through setting
  - History
  - Non-default assumptions
  - Lishun Sector
2. Discussion
3. Create characters

#### History

> 300,000 years ago, a mysterious race now called "the Ancients" took primitive
> humans from their home planet, and seeded them throughout the galaxy.  This
> has made a lot of people very angry and has been widely regarded as a bad
> move.
>
> About 7,000 years ago, the Vilani people from the planet Vland were the first
> humans to discover jump technology.  They gained the ability to travel between
> the stars.  Over those 7,000 years, they built up a vast empire, called the
> Ziru Sirka, which in their language means Grand Empire of the Stars.  At its
> height, it controlled over 15,000 worlds spread across 27 sectors of space.
>
> In about 60 years, the Terrans from the planet Earth will discover jump
> technology.
>
> In about 75 years, first contact will be made between the Terrans and the
> Vilani.
>
> And in about 100 years, war will break out between the Terran Confederation
> and the Ziru Sirka.  The Ziru Sirka is far, far bigger, but it's also in the
> midst of a long and slow decline.  Vilani society is very centralised, their
> culture is incredibly rigid, they've stagnated technologically, and with only
> jump-2 ships they simply can't effectively manage their vast territory.
>
> The war lasts about 200 years, and ends with the surrender of the Ziru Sirka.
> One imperium comes to an end, and another begins.  The Terrans---now calling
> themselves Solomani after our star---proclaim the Rule of Man, a kind of
> military state run by hereditary fleet admirals.
>
> But the Solomani couldn't halt the decline and fall of the Ziru Sirka.  After
> a scant 500 years, the Rule of Man collapsed.  And nothing replaced it.
>
> That began the Long Night, a period of galactic anarchy which saw the collapse
> of interstellar trade, diplomacy, and communication.  Many worlds couldn't
> maintain their high technology levels, or even feed their populations, with
> the imperial bureaucracy gone.  Some worlds reverted to barbarism or died out
> entirely.  Space became a lawless place where pirates and reavers preyed on
> those few brave enough to still travel between the stars.  And over a thousand
> years passed before interstellar civilisation began to re-emerge.
>
> One of the brightest lights in the darkness is the planet Sylea, last capital
> of the Rule of Man.  The Sylean Federation is now 650 years old, and that is
> where our game is set.

#### Discussion

##### Campaign

- No overarching story
- The world doesn't resolve around the PCs
- Time skips between sessions if you have no plans
- How long should the campaign last?
- Tone:
  - What kind of conflicts and adventures make sense for this game?
  - What kind of outcomes make sense for this game?
  - What kind of PCs make sense for this game?
  - Ethics (sexism, racism, slavery, etc): use it to make the bad guys obviously
    bad? Anything off limits?
  - Can PCs die?  How frequently?
    - What happens if there's a TPK?

##### Characters

- Alien PCs, yay or nay?
  - Aslan: probably pretty weird if from an Aslan enclave, so far from the
    Hierate.
  - Vargr: the Vargr Extents are just off to coreward, so ethnic Vargr are
    everywhere here.
- Psion PCs, yay or nay?
  - What about psion NPCs?
- Traveller Companion pre-career options, yay or nay?
  - Colonial Upbringing
  - Merchant Academy
  - Psionic Community
  - School of Hard Knocks
  - Spacer Community
- Advancement:
  - How did everyone feel about the standard rules?  I felt it penalised
    characters with low EDU too much.
  - Seth Skorkowsky house rule: mark skills which get used successfully, at the
    end of the adventure roll `1d6-1` for each marked skill and gain 1
    experience point if above the skill level.  Gaining a skill at level 0, or
    taking it from level 0 to level 1, costs 1xp; costs double each level
    thereafter.

- **Eayukheal**
  - *Alibi:* none volunteered
  - *Motive:* **Urshukaan** demands he dishonour his family
  - *Discovery:* automatic (incident)
  - *Clues:*
    - Aslan honour rules out stabbing someone in the back
    - Seen in the office at 22:00 (after the last possible time of death)
    - Narrow window of opportunity: office logs suggest he was there from 21:15
    - **Katarin** lies about his location on the night of the murder
  - Taciturn, just says "I did not kill him, I will say no more." but could be
    goaded by accusing him of backstabbing.

- **Chaijin Davis**
  - *Alibi:* in the casino
  - *Motive:* part of an extremist faction who want the Interstellar Confederacy free again
  - *Discovery:* automatic (Marja)
  - *Clues:* none (pure red herring)
  - Is very cooperative.
  - Initially assumes he's been locked up due to not paying his room fees.

  "Let me see him!  I'll fucking kill him if he touches her again, that rat
  bastard!"

  you", Urshukaan replies "Finally, lets get this bloody farce over with.  Show
  her in!"  A grim-faced woman is brought in.

  made your mistake and it's time you got used to living with it.  You're mine,
  for as long as I care to use you, you understand me?  Or would you prefer I
  get your family involved in this?"  "No sir."

> by Sly's old friend, the station manager and ex-bounty hunter Marja Aguilar.
> Marja put you in touch with Ringiil Urshukaan, president of Lamarck Minerals,
> and you were given a job to find a stolen ore carrier and identify the

> you.
>
> Later that night, Urshukaan was found dead.  The main starport dispatched a
> lazy and ambitious inspector known for hating Travellers who, Marja is sure,

>
> Marja doesn't have the resources to investigate a murder herself.  But she
> trusts Sly.  So she's asked you three to look into the matter, to secure
> enough legally-obtained evidence, that she can give the inspector proof of the
> identity of the real killer.
>
> It's now 10am of day 2 of the investigation.  The inspector will arrive at

2023-01-08 --- Session 4
------------------------

### Intro

> You're a group of private citizens working government contracts for the Sylean
> Federation Scout Service, out in Lishun Sector.
>
> Right now you're in the Uudge She system, looking into an abandoned Ziru Sirka
> mining outpost, to see if it can be reactivated and used as a source of
> valuable resources.  With you is a team of three prospectors: the chief Arkar
> Ullah, and his two assistants Kaarga Riaz and Petr Idema.
>
> The three-month journey from Raluug was mostly uneventful, other than Petr
> developing a crush on Vega, until the last jump: something struck your ship
> just as you were entering jump, knocking you off course.  Your jump drive
> managed to compensate, but burned itself out in the process, and will take one
> ton of spare parts to be repaired.
>
> You're now in orbit around the world of Uudge She.  You can immediately see
> that it's smaller than Earth, around the size of Mars, it has about 65%
> surface water, and is heavily forested.  Your navigational database says it
> has a tainted atmosphere requiring a filter mask, but no information on what
> that taint is.  And you know that somewhere down there is an old mining
> outpost, hopefully with enough spare parts to get your jump drive up and
> running.

### State

- In 1430 Uudge She
  - World unsurveyed, only physical UWP available
- J-Drive offline until repair
- 9 months until maintenance due
- Pending life support costs: 6 people x 12 weeks

### Prep

#### Prospectors

- **Arkar Ullah:**
  - Male, 56
  - The chief
  - Wears a flat cap and has a thick moustache
  - Doesn't talk much
  - Can identify unrefined metals at a glance

- **Kaarga Riaz:**
  - Male, 43
  - Short and stocky, stronger than he looks
  - Holds his drink well

- **Petr Idema:**
  - Male, 25
  - Narrow face, short copper hair
  - Fairly new to the job, not very experienced
  - Crush on Vega

- Personal equipment: TL10 Vacc Suit, Autopistol, assorted gear (cutting toches, shovels, mineral analysis kit, etc)

#### Uudge She

- Atmospheric taint is metal fragments stirred up by the frequent storms
- Native life is scaly and can seal off orifices (ear / nose plugs, translucent
  eyelids, etc) to protect
- Cool, dry
- Secret Vargr corsair station in orbit around the system's gas giant:
  - 3 Aetin Scouts (with double pulse lasers)
  - 1 Ruguelka Corsair

- **Human inhabitants:**
  - The descendants of the original miners
  - TL0 / stone-age primitives, living in tents with their animals
  - Wear thick hooded cloaks to deal with the metal storms, but prefer being in
    their tents if possible
  - Speak a heavily accented Vilani dialect (`INT / Language (Vilani)`)
  - Have developed a mythology of lost golden age, which the Thunder Gods ended
    by pulling the stars apart and preventing travel between worlds
  - Assume the players are emissaries of the Thunder Gods, sent to judge them
  - More women and children than adult men
  - Adult men have lanthanum-tipped spears (can be identified on sight by Arkar) and are often scarred
  - Consider the mining outpost full of demons
  - Consider passing through the mining outpost, descending into the caves, and obtaining your own spear-tip a rite of passage

- **Mining outpost:**
  - As Hadley's Hope (ALIEN rulebook), but:
    - C block is recreation & family services
    - D block is the mining area (a big pit in the ground with a lift and heavy machinery)
      - Top of pit covered by resin
      - Stairway heading down to caves at the base
    - Ramp from D block to maintenance bay
  - Walls covered by layers upon layers of secreted resin, giving corridors a
    gullet-like appearance
  - Warm, humid, smells of ozone
  - Spare parts in maintenance bay
  - Starting sliens:
    - Creepers (Flatlined): Command Crew Quarters, C1 vents, Medlab, Billy's Bar
    - Chamax (Drinax): North Lock, South Lock, Mass Housing
  - Random Encounters (2-in-6, every 2 turns, then every turn after making noise):
    - 1 radio interference
    - 2, 3 Creeper
    - 4 Chamax

#### Income

- 3 months to establish the colony
- Then it'll produce 500 tons of Uncommon Raw Materials per month (Cr10,000,000/month)
- Of that, assuming 75% is profit (Cr7,500,000/month)
- The PCs get 5%, as the other 5% goes to the prospectors (Cr375,000/month)
- Half the first three paying months to cover the cost of establishing the colony (Cr187,500/month)
- So the PCs will receive:
  - Month 1, 2, 3: Cr187,500
  - Month 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12: Cr375,000
  - Total: Cr3,937,500

- **Back-of-the-napkin profit estimate:**
  - Mortgage is deferred while the PCs are working, so assume they're not paying that
  - Maintenance is Cr22,702/month
  - 82 tons of refined fuel twice a month is Cr41,000/month
  - 30 days of life support for 3 people is Cr6000/month
  - Berthing fees is probably around Cr6000/month
  - Total: Cr75,702/month
  - So they'll have Cr100,000--Cr300,000/month extra, which is a lot, but not a
    fortune - not even enough to pay the mortgage

### Notes

  - Detect inhabitants
  - Detect mining base

  - Character sheet for Ed
  - Add Uudge She UWP to player map
- Founding of the Third Imperium


2023-01-15 --- Session 5

    - Locker
    - Power!

- First mining money in 6 months time

> You're a group of private citizens working government contracts for the Sylean
> Federation Scout Service, out in Lishun Sector.
>
> Right now you're in the Raluug system, where you've been for a few weeks now
> sorting out the voluminous paperwork that comes with getting a new ship, which
> is only increased by the fact that you're trading in an existing mortgage to
> fund it.
>
> The talk of the station while you've been here has been the secession of
> several old and established worlds from the Sylean Federation.  There's been
> people on the TV predicting the imminent collapse of the Federation and the
> start of a new Long Night, but other than being slightly disturbed by the
> news, nothing really has changed around these parts.
>
> And now all the paperwork is done, you've got your ship, you've got the keys,
> you've moved your stuff over, and Ed---your new Vargr crewmate---has adjusted
> the pilot's chair to just how he likes it.  It's time to head out to Indmen to
> investigate a potential ancient alien signal with Prof. Joe Arif of the
> University of Sylea's Xenoarchaeology Department.  However this is *not* an
> official S.F.S.S. mission, unless you find a way to make it one, so your
> mortgage repayments won't be paused while you do this, you'll have to repay
> any payments you owe when you return to Federation space.

### Prep

- **Prof. Joe Arif:**
  - Will *not shut up* about the Ancients
  - Considers the Archon Hypothesis absolute poppycock
  - Lalita Ward (grad student) is much more grounded and polite

- **Indmen:**
  - Acid oceans & acid storms
  - Locating the signal origin from orbit: `Difficult INT / Electronics (sensors)`
  - Flying through the storm: `Difficult DEX / Pilot (spacecraft)`
  - Pyramid fires a laser at approaching ships, as in *Shadows*
  - Pyramid interior is Droyne base from *Twilight's Peak*, but:
    - Use Random Encounters from *Secrets of the Ancients*
    - N has two hostile Servitors (*Secrets of the Ancients*)
    - Walls and ceiling are covered in a very detailed and intricate non-repeating geometric design which hurts the eyes and distracts the mind (DM-2 to INT and EDU tasks)
    - No signs of prior human entry
    - Low berths in O cannot be opened
    - S / Z is the stargate room
      - Holographic controls
      - Walls show a starchart as seen from this world 300,000 years ago (`Very Difficult INT / Astrogation`)
      - Pick out six symbols: `Difficult PSI` (characters with psionic potential 5+ only)
      - Recognising the pattern gives the seventh symbol
  - Trying to activate the stargate exhausts the power
    - Prof. suggests plugging the ship into the base!
    - Grad student more sensibly suggests returning with a portable fusion generator
  - Actually activating the stargate gives a burst of gamma radiation (150 rads) and opens a bidirectional portal to another stargate in a lab in the Zhodani Consulate
