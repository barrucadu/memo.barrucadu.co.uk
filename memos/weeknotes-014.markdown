## Ph.D

- I've finished all the corrections!  I also got in touch with my
  supervisor to find out the next steps: he suggests I write a
  document briefly saying how I addressed each correction before
  resubmitting.  The good news is that there can be a further round of
  minor corrections; so if I've missed something out I can get a
  further three months to address that before the final final
  deadline.

## Work

- I was only working on Monday and Tuesday this week, from Wednesday
  onwards I've been on leave, and will be back at work on the 2nd of
  January.

- On Monday I got called in the evening about the site having issues
  (I've been [on call since last Wednesday][]), where it seemed that
  our VMs were having difficulty talking to each other.  After a
  fairly fruitless half an hour of debugging with the other on-call
  dev, the problem went away by itself.  At the moment we suspect a
  network issue with our hosting provider.

## Miscellaneous

- A couple of the recent Advent of Code challenges have involved
  disassembling code for a fictional CPU.  These can be pretty fun,
  but a bit tricky to solve if you're not familiar with how
  higher-level constructs like loops and conditionals get compiled
  into jumps.

  For example, [Day 19][] involved a program which computed the sums
  of the divisors of a large number.  The fictional CPU doesn't have
  division, so it worked by using loops, additions, and
  multiplications.  [There's a tale of my reverse engineering in my
  solution][], which I might write up as a full memo (along with the
  other related puzzles), as there are a few different techniques
  involved.

- I'm now visiting family until the 29th.

- This memo is a day late because time doesn't exist during holidays.
