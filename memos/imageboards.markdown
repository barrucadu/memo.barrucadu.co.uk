Ones I Know
-----------

[4chan](http://www.4chan.org)
  ~ A pile of crap. There is no reason go there, but this list would
  feel woefully incomplete without it.

[8chan](https://8ch.pl/)
  ~ Probably the biggest still-living 4chan alternative. Has a
  reddit-like model where anyone can create their own board. The
  average board quality tends to be quite low.

[lainchan](https://lainchan.org)
  ~ Pretty good. I am an admin. kalyx (previous owner) was unstable
  and probably the worst thing about lainchan, other than the politics
  board. Site was in a perpetual state of "about to be sold", ~~but
  this has yet to actually happen~~ and it actually happened,
  Appleman1234 bought the site from kalyx! See also irc.lainchan.org.

nullchan
  ~ lainchan's "rivals", they were behind a lot of DDoSes and
  blackmail back in the day. But now they don't exist, sucks to be
  them.

[sushichan](https://sushigirl.us)
  ~ Slow. Very cosy. Used to be sushigirl.tokyo, but the old owner
  went into the mountains and vanished (he's confirmed still alive).
  Now run by a guy called Seisatsu. See #sushigirl on freenode.
  /kaitensushi/ best board.

[uboachan](https://uboachan.net)
  ~ Also run by Seisatsu. I don't know anything else about it.

(secret)
  ~ Totally avoids all the negative aspects of imageboard culture.
  Ultimate in cosy. Only open during certain hours.


Culture
-------

Imageboard culture is a strange beast. The only constant is "lurk
more". If in doubt, try to gauge the culture of a board before posting
in it.

I've heard it said that [VA-11 HALL-A](http://waifubartending.com) is
to imageboard culture what [Undertale](http://undertale.com) is to
tumblr culture. Given that I enjoyed the former and was bored by the
latter, that might be the case.

### Anime

Imageboard culture has a lot of overlap with anime culture. There's a
crowd who dispute this, but they are wrong. Most imageboards will have
a dedicated anime board, and those which don't will still have
frequent anime discussion (unless it's banned outright, but I haven't
seen that anywhere).

Anime, manga, and doujinshi is a common source for post images.

### Identification

Providing any identifying information about yourself is a big no-no
unless clearly relevant to the discussion.

A user may include a name with their post, but to do so is almost
universally frowned upon and seen as attention-seeking at best (see
**namefag** and **tripfag**). A user may also include an email address
with their post, but to actually *use* that is so rare that the field
has been repurposed to communicate textual metadata (see **noko** and
**sage**).

The general philosophy is that posts should stand or fall on their
individual merits, and who the poster actually is doesn't matter. It's
even a little contentious that *staff* can tie multiple posts to the
same user, and may be influenced by this when making decisions.

### Politics

Those who talk about politics tend to be on the extremes, and the
extremes on imageboards are *more* extreme than what you might be used
to. If you feel uncomfortable with discussion about how
liberals/muslims/jews (quite a popular bogeyman)/gays/etc are ruining
the world, stay out of political boards. They are a cesspit.

Moderating political discussion on an imageboard is one of the least
pleasant tasks you can do online. As soon as you take some visible
action, people accuse you of bias and kick up a shitstorm.


Moderation
----------

Imageboards traditionally have four very coarse-grained levels of
staff:

Administrators
  ~ They can do everything. Traditionally, there is only one, but this
  is not necessarily the case. Some examples of admin-only powers are:
  creating and deleting users, creating and deleting boards, modifying
  user permissions. The capcode is traditionally "## Admin".

Global Moderators
  ~ Like moderators, but with power over every board. The capcode is
  traditionally "## Mod".

Moderators
  ~ The bulk of your typical imageboard's staff. On their boards, they
  can do basically anything: delete, move, and edit posts and images;
  ban users; spoiler and unspoiler images; bumplock threads; sticky
  threads; and so on. The capcode is traditionally "## Mod".

Janitors
  ~ They can delete posts. The idea of the position is that relying on
  users to report bad posts is unreliable, and so janitors are more
  proactive. They may have access to staff-only boards, which regular
  users don't, and whatnot. They get no capcode. Typically, revealing
  that you are a janitor is grounds for immediate dismissal.

### So you're a mod. Now what?

You have somehow found yourself in the position of an imageboard
moderator, and have seen a post which merits moderation: what do you
do?

- **Is it sharing illegal material?**

    For example, child pornography. Delete post and ban IP forever.

- **Does it clearly break the rules?**

    The user needs to be banned, but should the ban be public? Should
    the post be deleted? These are both cultural issues. The
    guidelines here work for lainchan, but be sure to know the
    feelings of the more experienced staff of the imageboard you are
    moderating.

    - *Has it been responded to, or has the post been around for a
      while?*

        If so, it might be disruptive to delete it.

    - *Has the post not been responded to, or is it fairly new?*

        Deleting it is probably safe.

    - *Is the ban going to be for a long time, or is the post really
      bad?*

        Probably go for a public ban. Public bans serve two purposes:
        they reassure users that the bad poster has been dealt with,
        and they act as a warning and a reminder that moderation is
        happening.

    - *Is the ban for a short time, or is the post only just over the
      line?*

        No public ban. If users see lots of public bans for what they
        perceive as small offences, they are likely to complain "mods
        are nazis" or something.

        Bear in mind that a user can make a non-public ban public, by
        posting a screenshot of the ban message.

- **Does it arguably break the rules?**

    Decide if it actually does or not. This may be easier to do in
    discussion with other staff. Then see **does it clearly break the
    rules?**, but bear in mind that the post is on the borderline: so
    probably a short non-public ban.

- **Is it just generally low quality?**

    Is there an expected tone on this board? If so, the post may be
    worth deleting, and a (non-public) very short ban given to the
    user to convey some information. Vichan can be configured to show
    users a ban message even if it has expired by the time they next
    visit the site: this can be used to give users "warnings", a very
    short ban with a message about post quality.

    This is the trickiest category to enforce, as it's easy to be
    swayed by personal bias. Ensure your moderation is fair!

- **Is it off-topic, but still good?**

    Then it may be a good idea to move the post to a new thread, move
    the thread to a new board, or modpost in the thread to try to get
    the discussion back on track.

If you are unsure, talk to your fellow staff! We do it for the same
reason: to have the best imageboard we can.

And remember: discussion of moderation *within a thread itself* is
almost always off-topic. Don't get caught up in that if people
question your decisions (and it's easy to do so!). If there is a
meta-discussion board, redirect moderation criticism to there.
