## Ph.D

- I got some feedback from my supervisor.  It was mostly minor
  changes, but there was one case where [I added a new full-page
  figure][].  Now it's back with him.

## Work

- This week has been firebreak, the week between quarters where people
  can do whatever they want as long as it's useful, and I made a [tech
  support rota generator][].  I wrote up a memo about [solving this
  sort of problem][].

## Miscellaneous

- The [kombucha][] I [started fermenting last week][] finished its
  first fermentation, so I split it up into 500ml portions and
  flavoured it.  Unfortunately the earthy taste of the tea had
  completely disappeared, so I branched out from considering just
  flavours which would go with that.  I went for pineapple, pear,
  cherry, ginger, strawberry and raspberry, and tea (the same).  After
  two days it had finished flavouring (the second fermentation), so I
  bottled it and left it for another two days to build up some
  carbonation (the third fermentation), and then put them in the
  fridge.

  I tried the cherry one, and it was much nicer refrigerated.  When I
  tasted it at the end of the second fermentation, it had a very
  strong yeasty taste, but that had gone away (though it still had a
  strong yeasty smell).  Unfortunately two days was not enough time to
  build up the carbonation, so I've taken them all out of the fridge
  again to leave for a few more days.

  It seems a common beginner mistake is to not stir the kombucha at
  the end of the first fermentation, which results in really uneven
  carbonation when you bottle it, as the yeast sinks to the bottom.  I
  didn't stir it, so maybe I'll have one or two really carbonated
  bottles but the rest will be flat, we'll see.

- I also started making some vinegar, once I freed up some of the
  containers I was using for kombucha.  I've started one batch of
  whisky vinegar and one of red wine vinegar.  These will take
  somewhere between two weeks and two months.
