## Books

This week I read:

- [The Third Imperium][], a sourcebook for Traveller

  Lots of good information about the Third Imperium and its history,
  which I plan to use in future games, though I felt the description
  of the worlds of the Core sector were a bit lacking: each subsector
  only had a few worlds detailed.  In some cases a description of one
  world would refer to another world, and then that other world didn't
  have a description, it's a bit sparse compared to the sourcebook on
  the Trojan Reach sector.  The worlds which are described have longer
  descriptions, but on the whole I think I'd prefer shorter
  descriptions of more worlds than longer descriptions of fewer
  worlds.

## Roleplaying Games

### Work D&D

This week I ran session #2 of Winter's Daughter for my work RPG group.
Since the office is shut for the next few weeks, we played online
using Foundry, which worked out well.

We finished the module, and they managed to give me a couple of
*perfect* hooks to turn this into a larger campaign centred around
dealing with the potential return of the frost elves:

1. When they visited the tower in which Princess Snowfall-at-Dusk was
   imprisoned, most of the characters took one look at the frost elf
   nobles and said "no, not engaging with that, let's go straight to
   the princess."  Except one character, who decided to hang out with
   the elves.  And then told them that she was from the mortal world.

   The elves were all *very* interested in this, since there's a
   magical barrier keeping the mortal world and the realm of Frigia
   apart, but now they know there's a way through.  Lord
   Mantle-of-Runes was summoned to interrogate the player characters,
   but they escaped before he arrived and gave me hook #2:

2. When they reunited Sir Chyde and Princess Snowfall-at-Dusk, and she
   offered them one wish as a reward, they wished to be back in the
   mortal world, *with an exact duplicate of Sir Chyde's magical
   ring*.  If you've not read the module, it's the magic ring being in
   the mortal realm which is weakening the barrier with Frigia.

   The players didn't want to leave the ring behind, because a wizard
   hired them to get it, and they wanted his money.  But by bringing
   an exact copy of the ring back to the mortal world, they've ensured
   the weakness in the magical barrier will remain, and potentially
   even grow.

So, the frost elves know there's a weakness in the barrier with the
mortal world, and the players have doomed that weakness to grow even
more.  Excellent.  The rest of the campaign can *easily* be structured
around the potential return of the frost elves, and trying to stop
that from happening.  We can even have a cool "cast it into the fire!"
style moment when we get the reveal of the ring *they brought back*
being part of the problem.

Unlike my other Dolmenwood campaign, this one isn't a sandbox.  I've
decided that, since 4 of the 6 players are totally new to RPGs, they'd
probably benefit from a more traditional plot-based game where I drive
the overall story forwards.  I'll definitely hint at and briefly show
some of the other Dolmenwood stuff, to show them that there is a
larger world out there and it's not just this one story, but this
campaign is about the frost elves.

### Sylea Rising

On the 11th of September, I'll be running session 0 of our Wicked Ones
campaign.  I'm really looking forward to it.  But Wicked Ones is
designed for a campaign of about 16 3-to-5 hour sessions, so it's
probably going to end around April or May next year.  If we stick to
one campaign, rather than alternating two, it'll finish around January
or February.

And so I've been thinking a little about the *next* campaign after
that, and I've come around to the idea of doing more Traveller!

Here's the pitch I gave my players for a campaign set before the
beginning of the Third Imperium, which I'm calling *Sylea Rising*:

> The Ziru Sirka, the great interstellar empire of the Vilani, lasted
> for two thousand years.  But inability to manage such a large
> expanse of territory caused a slow decline, which ultimately led to
> its conquest by the Terrans, and the establishment of their great
> interstellar empire: the Rule of Man.
>
> But the Rule of Man lasted a scant few centuries before it, too,
> collapsed under its own weight.  This time, nothing replaced it.
> The galaxy fell into anarchy, worlds were cut off from one another,
> technologies were lost, and many civilisations simply failed to
> survive: this is the Long Night, and this is when our game is set.
>
> In the Long Night many small pocket empires rose, and fell.  You are
> all scouts, ex-military, and similar sorts, employed by the
> government of the Sylean Federation, one of the larger pocket
> empires of the Long Night.  The Sylean Federation is a group of
> systems all within about 30 parsecs of the planet Sylea.  It's
> survived for 650 years now, but Sylea, too, is feeling the strain of
> administration at interstellar distances, and is also currently at
> war with two other pocket empires: the Interstellar Confederacy and
> the Chanestin Kingdom.  Can Sylea solve its problems, or will it
> perish like so many others?
>
> **Player buy-in:** The player characters are all explorers working
> government contracts to reach out to worlds not heard from in
> centuries (or millennia), to establish peaceful relations where
> possible, or maybe just to plunder them if the world is dead---after
> all, who's to say you handed in *everything* you found to the
> government inspectors?  It's post-apocalypse in space.  There will
> be space dungeons.  But it's also about the rise of the Sylean
> Federation into something even greater, so there's plenty of scope
> for this to turn into a more political game if you want.

I gave a few other campaign pitches too, but this is the most popular
(and also my favourite), so it's looking likely that this will be our
game after Wicked Ones.  Of course, April (or February) is a long way
away, and things might change by then, but I do quite like this
premise.
