        <p>Greetings, <strong>CONTRACTOR_NAME</strong></p>

        <h2>News In Brief</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>The worlds of Unrair, Unkuu, Irurk, Aggii Ganaan, Irmap Muu, Nirnirk, Bala, Zuarkri, and Kain have chosen to withdraw from the Federation in an unprecedented move.  Relations remain friendly and there is no need to be alarmed by this "syexit".</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Opportunities</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>PULSAR L713</strong> is due for its next benchmarking survey.  A survey team will need to travel 30+ parsecs coreward to take measurements of pulsar emissions, so navigational databases can be kept up to date.
            <br>Enquire of Dr. Gharib in the Science Office.</li>
          <li><strong>BOLDLY GO!</strong> Can you survey an entire subsector?  Detailed surveys are required of all uncontacted worlds, to support future scouting, colonisation, and recontact activities.
            <br>Submit surveys to the Astrographical Office.</li>
          <li><strong>INTERESTED IN THE INTELLIGENCE SERVICE?</strong> Discretion and a successful background check required.
            <br>Enquire at the Intelligence Office.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Ship's mortgage repayments are frozen while on official S.F.S.S. business!</p>

        <p>As always, there is a standing reward of 10% of the first year's profits for all commercially exploitable discoveries, plus further discretionary rewards for especially significant finds.</p>

        <h2>Public Service Announcements</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Due to scalpers taking advantage of underdeveloped worlds, exporting pharmaceuticals now requires a license.</li>
          <li>Travellers are reminded that all biological imports must go through quarantine before being allowed onto the station.</li>
        </ul>
